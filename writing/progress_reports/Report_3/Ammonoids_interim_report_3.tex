Just recently, the happy news came out that a another ammonoid survivor has been found in Denmark, \textit{Fresvillia} \parencite{machalskiAmmoniteSurvivalCretaceous2025}. This new find doesn't change the results very much overall. It does weaken the abundance-survivorship association, \textit{Fresvillia} is not highly abundant in the data (figure \ref{fig_abundance}). 

It appears that geographic range did not play an important role in determining survival for either nautilids or ammonoids. 
The analysis now includes rare taxa known from less than three locations. I have previously excluded them because I can only draw a convex hull around three locations. We solved this issue by adding a 10km buffer around their occurrences. 

Intriguingly, I find a weak association between ammonoid hatching size and survival -- it is just that it is the genera with \textit{smaller} hatching sizes that appear to have survived into the early Danian.

Some caveats: I am continuing to search for further occurrences from the literature. Hopefully I can find occurrences from areas that are poorly sampled, such as parts of South America, Africa (Madagascar?), and Asia. Also, in some places, I have resorted to using a non-parametric test as a rough-and-ready tool to get some indication if the pattern I am seeing is real or not. Doing so is not ideal, it looks a bit like $p$-hacking (i.e. just doing a lot of tests and then reporting the statistically significant ones. The problem is: Doing lots of statistical tests will result in some tests  returning a statistically significant result just by chance). We are trying out several statistical approaches at the moment to see if we can find an approach that works with this data.

\section*{Results}

\textbf{Spatial bias in fossil occurrences.} To visualise spatial bias in sampling intensity in our dataset, we apply a Gaussian kernel density to the spatial distribution of nautilid and ammonoid fossil locations (figure \ref{fig_locdensity}). 

\begin{figure}
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{/diagnostic_plots/Fossil_occurrence_density.pdf}
\caption{The global distribution of Maastrichtian shelled cephalopods reported in our dataset is highly heterogenous. 
Black circles mark every location where a Maastrichtian ammonoid or nautilid belonging to a genus that is extant at the end of the Maastrichtian has been found. 
Red crosses mark the four locations with plausible Danian ammonoid survivors (from left to right: Mississippi, New Jersey, Maastricht, and Stevn Klint). Grey shaded areas are Gaussian kernel densities of fossil occurrence locations and mark regions with exceptionally high sampling.}
\label{fig_locdensity}
\end{figure}

We identify six hotspots of Maastrichtian shelled cephalopod fossil finds.
Going clockwise, these are North America, Europe, the coast of Eastern Russia (Sakhalin island), Western Australia, the Antarctic peninsula (Seymour island), and central Chile. There is a clear association between sampling intensity and the probability of identifying Danian ammonoid survivors.
The four locations with the most convincing Danian ammonoid finds all lie within the North American and European regions of high sampling intensity (figure \ref{fig_locdensity}). 

\noindent
\textbf{Ammonoid and nautilid geographic range sizes.} Our estimates of the geographic range size of ammonoid genera do not support the idea that ammonoid survivors had larger geographic ranges. Though many genera that survived in the short term had large geographic ranges (figure \ref{fig_ammon_georanges}, see also figure \ref{fig_geo_surv}a), they are not exceptional among late Maastrichtian ammonoids (Wilcoxon rank sum test, $W = 91$, $p = 0.9$, areas estimated using the PALEOMAP \parencite{scotesePALEOMAPPaleoAtlasGPlates2020} plate tectonic model). 

\begin{figure}
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{/geographic_distributions/ammonoids/ammonoids_geographic_ranges.pdf}
\caption{Geographic range sizes of Maastrichtian ammonoids estimated from fossil occurrences. To reconstruct the geographic location of fossil occurrences during the Maastrichtian, we use five different plate tectonic models:
Merdith \parencite{merdithExtendingFullplateTectonic2021},
Torsvik and Cocks \parencite{torsvikEarthHistoryPalaeogeography2016},
Golonka \parencite{wrightCommunitydrivenPaleogeographicReconstructions2013},
Matthews 2016 \parencite{matthewsGlobalPlateBoundary2016}, and
Paleomap \parencite{scotesePALEOMAPPaleoAtlasGPlates2020}.
The geographic range of each genus is approximated as a minimum convex hull enclosing all fossil locations of the genus. The area of the resulting polygon is an approximation of the genus range. 
For each genus, circles indicate the area estimated with each plate tectonic model, and red diamonds indicate the median area across models. Genera highlighted in red went extinct at the end of the Cretaceous.}
\label{fig_ammon_georanges}
\end{figure}

The same holds true when we consider ammonoid geographic range sizes corrected for various biases. We correct for bias in collection effort and from outliers by subsampling occurrence data. There are no differences in the median geographic range size estimated from  bootstrapped (figure \ref{fig_ammon_subsamp}a, Wilcoxon rank sum test, $W = 115$, $p = 0.153$) or jackknifed occurrence data (figure \ref{fig_ammon_subsamp}b, Wilcoxon rank sum test, $W = 91$, $p = 0.764$. All areas reported in this section are estimated using the PALEOMAP \parencite{scotesePALEOMAPPaleoAtlasGPlates2020} plate tectonic model). We also correct for inflated geographic range estimates resulting from the inclusion of areas that were on land during the Maastrichtian. Using coastline reconstructions from \textcite{kocsisMappingPaleocoastlinesContinental2021}, we restricted our geographic range estimates to marine areas only. The median marine area is slightly larger for ammonoid survivor genera (figure \ref{fig_geo_surv}b). However, this difference is not significant (Wilcoxon rank sum test, $W = 77$, $p = 0.478$).

The same picture emerges for nautilids. There are no detectable differences in the geographic range sizes of surviving and extinct genera, neither from raw occurrences (figure \ref{fig_geo_surv}a, Wilcoxon rank-sum test, $W = 6$, $p = 1$), nor median areas from bootstrapped (figure \ref{fig_nauti_subsamp}a, Wilcoxon rank-sum test, $W = 2$, $p = 0.4$) or jackknifed occurrences (figure \ref{fig_nauti_subsamp}b, Wilcoxon rank-sum test, $W = 3$, $p = 0.7$, all areas estimated using the PALEOMAP \parencite{scotesePALEOMAPPaleoAtlasGPlates2020} plate tectonic model). The same holds when we consider only those areas that were marine (figure \ref{fig_geo_surv}b, $W = 12$, $p = 0.517$).

\noindent
\textbf{Ammonoid hatching sizes.} Published hatching sizes are available for 23 Late Maastrichtian ammonoid genera (figure \ref{fig_ammon_hatch}), three of which are Danian survivors. Median hatching size of genera that survived (median 0.72 mm) during the end-Cretaceous mass extinction are slightly smaller than those of genera that went extinct (median 0.93 mm, $W = 51$, $p = 0.0352$). This is the opposite of what would be expected if large hatching sizes protected against extinction \parencite{debaetsEarlyEvolutionaryTrends2012,
laptikhovskyEnvironmentalImpactEctocochleate2012, kennedyThoughtsEvolutionExtinction1989}.

\begin{figure}

\end{figure}

\noindent
\textbf{Are the high abundances of short-term ammonoid survivors due to preferential collecting of these genera?} Potentially, ammonoid survivors occur more frequently in our dataset because the fact that they survived make them interesting targets for collection. We check for this possibility by comparing the abundance of ammonoid genera in the Maastrichtian with their abundance in the preceding Campanian (figure \ref{fig_ammon_campanian}). We assume that any collection bias will be limited to the Maastrichtian because that is the stage that is most relevant to the subsequent mass extinction event. We expect less interest in these genera in the Campanian. Increased collection effort for specifically these survivor genera should cause a jump in their abundance from the Campanian to the Maastrichtian. 

We find no clear indication of such a jump in abundance (figure \ref{fig_ammon_campanian}). Two genera, \textit{Discoscaphites} and \textit{Sphenodiscus}, are decidedly more abundant in the Maastrichtian, which is consistent with the collection bias hypothesis. However, other survivor genera (\textit{Hoploscaphites}, \textit{Baculites}, \textit{Pachydiscus}) are already highly abundant in the Campanian, which suggests that targeted collection of these genera is unlikely to account for their reported abundance in the Maastrichtian. Furthermore, the survivor genera fit in a wider trend in which ammonoids extant at the very end of the Maastrichtian (figure \ref{fig_ammon_campanian}, dark blue circles) tend to grow more abundant in the Maastrichtian compared to the Campanian. This is not the case for ammonoid genera that became extinct before the end of the Maastrichtian (figure \ref{fig_ammon_campanian}, light blue circles).
 
\begin{figure}
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{/abundance_survivalship/Genus_abundance_comparison.png}
\caption{No evidence for preferential collecting of short-term ammonoid survivors. Abundances of ammonoid (blue) and nautilid (orange) genera for the Maastrichtian and Campanian.
Only genera that were extant in both stages are shown. 
Light blue circles show ammonoid genera that were no longer extant at the end of the Maastrichtian, dark blue circles mark genera that were extant at the beginning of the end-Cretaceous mass extinction.
The red dashed lines mark equal number of occurrences in both stages.}
\label{fig_ammon_campanian}
\end{figure}

\noindent
\textbf{Surviving ammonoid genera are found at a greater number of sites.} This also holds when we filter out ambiguity in occurrence locations with an equal-area grid, and we count the number of grid cells rather than the raw number of locations (figure \ref{fig_gridcell_surv}). 

\begin{figure}
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{/abundance_survivalship/Genus_numcell_survival.png}
\caption{Ammonoid genera that survived the end-Cretaceous mass extinction are found at more sites than genera that went extinct. There is no such difference for nautilid genera.

Red diamonds indicate the median, and the red error bars show the interquartile range.}

\section*{Methods}

\noindent
\textbf{Data sources and cleaning.} 
We search the literature for further Maastrichtian nautilid and ammonoid fossil occurrences and added them to the dataset. 

We follow \textcite{landmanScaphitesNodosusGroup2010} in considering the genus \textit{Jeletzkites} a synonym of \textit{Hoploscaphites}. We therefore reassign all \textit{Jeletzkites} occurrences in our dataset to \textit{Hoploscaphites}. 

Hatching sizes for Maastrichtian ammonoids are taken from \parencite{laptikhovskyEnvironmentalImpactEctocochleate2012, debaetsAmmonoidEmbryonicDevelopment2015, takaiConservativeOntogeneticTrajectories2022, shigetaNewSpeciesTetragonites2024}. 


In contrast to nautiloids, ammonoids evolved fast and taxa underwent rapid turnover. Therefore, the composition of ammonoid taxa changed within the six million years of the Maastrichtian. This timespan is too short to be reflected in the PaleoDB, where the temporal resolution of an occurrence is often limited to the stage of the rocks it is found in.
Unfortunately, we also observe that taxa which did not live during the Maastrichtian are present in the dataset with Maastrichtian age ranges. 
To address these two issues, we cross-check all ammonoid genera with the literature \parencite{wrightTreatiseInvertebratePaleontology1996, hoffmannRecentAdvancesHeteromorph2021, jagt-yazykovaPalaeobiogeographicalPalaeobiologicalAspects2011, landmanAmmoniteExtinctionNautilid2014} to ensure only those taxa would be analysed that were actually present at the cusp of the end-Cretaceous mass extinction. We conclude that 38 of the 81 ammonoid genera in the dataset were extant at the end of the Maastrichtian. 

\noindent
\textbf{Identifying sampling hotspots.} To identify regions with high sampling intensity, we apply a Gaussian kernel density estimate to the locations of all fossil occurrences in our dataset, an approach inspired by that of \textcite{chiarenzaEcologicalNicheModelling2019}. 
We estimate Gaussian kernel densities in ggplot2 \parencite{wickhamGgplot2ElegantGraphics2016} by using the function stat\_density\_2d() and narrowing the bandwidth by 20\%.
The resulting map is plotted with Robinson projection. 

\noindent
\textbf{Geographic ranges of low-occurrence taxa.} To include taxa in our analysis that are reported from less than three distinct locations, we drew a 10 km buffer \parencite{caseyEffectsGeographicRange2021, myersSharksThatPass2010, hendricksUsingGISStudy2008, malanoskiClimateChangeImportant2024} around the locations using the R function buffer() from the terra package \parencite{hijmansTerraSpatialData2025}.  

\noindent
\textbf{Subsampling routines.} 
To disambiguate cases where occurrences of a given taxon were sourced from the same location but reported with slightly different coordinates, we filter the occurrence data. We do so by drawing an equal-area grid over the occurrences using the terra function rast() and the Equal-Earth projection \parencite{savricEqualEarthMap2019}. Each grid cell had 25 km long sides.  
If multiple occurrences are located in the same grid cell, we retain a single occurrence. 

Subsequently, we employ two further subsampling routines on the filtered data. We bootstrap filtered occurrences to correct for differences in sampling effort. For all taxa with occurrences from more than three locations, we randomly sample three locations without replacement from the data. As before, we then determine the area of a minimum convex hull around those three locations. We repeat these steps until either a maximum of 1000 unique samples has been drawn, or all possible three-way combinations of fossil occurrence locations have been tried. 

We also perform jackknifing to correct for the effect of geographic outliers (e.g. locations that might have been misreported). For all taxa with occurrences from more than three locations, we remove a single location and record the area of a minimum 
convex hull drawn around the remaining locations. We repeat these steps until either a maximum of 1000 unique samples has been reached or all possible combinations have been sampled. 

\noindent
\textbf{Excising land area from geographic range estimates.} Our convex hull approximations of geographic range will often overestimate the range of a given taxon because some of the resulting polygon will cover ground that was on land during the Maastrichtian. To correct for this factor, we remove areas from the convex hulls that were terrestrial during the Maastrichtian. Coastline reconstructions using the PALEOMAP plate tectonic model are available from \parencite{kocsisMappingPaleocoastlinesContinental2021}. 
With these coastlines, we trim down the convex hulls so that the geographic ranges contain only marine areas. We do so for the PALEOMAP \parencite{scotesePALEOMAPPaleoAtlasGPlates2020} reconstructions only.
