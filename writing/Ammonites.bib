  abstract = {An asteroid impact at the end of the Cretaceous caused mass extinction, but extinction mechanisms are not well-understood. The collapse of sea surface to sea floor carbon isotope gradients has been interpreted as reflecting a global collapse of primary productivity (Strangelove Ocean) or export productivity (Living Ocean), which caused mass extinction higher in the marine food chain. Phytoplankton-dependent benthic foraminifera on the deep-sea floor, however, did not suffer significant extinction, suggesting that export productivity persisted at a level sufficient to support their populations. We compare benthic foraminiferal records with benthic and bulk stable carbon isotope records from the Pacific, Southeast Atlantic, and Southern Oceans. We conclude that end-Cretaceous decrease in export productivity was moderate, regional, and insufficient to explain marine mass extinction. A transient episode of surface ocean acidification may have been the main cause of extinction of calcifying plankton and ammonites, and recovery of productivity may have been as fast in the oceans as on land.},

  abstract = {Many traits have been linked to extinction risk among modern vertebrates, including mode of life and body size. However, previous work has indicated there is little evidence that body size, or any other trait, was selective during past mass extinctions. Here, we investigate the impact of the Triassic–Jurassic mass extinction on early Archosauromorpha (basal dinosaurs, crocodylomorphs and their relatives) by focusing on body size and other life history traits. We built several new archosauromorph maximum-likelihood supertrees, incorporating uncertainty in phylogenetic relationships. These supertrees were then employed as a framework to test whether extinction had a phylogenetic signal during the Triassic–Jurassic mass extinction, and whether species with certain traits were more or less likely to go extinct. We find evidence for phylogenetic signal in extinction, in that taxa were more likely to become extinct if a close relative also did. However, there is no correlation between extinction and body size, or any other tested trait. These conclusions add to previous findings that body size, and other traits, were not subject to selection during mass extinctions in closely-related clades, although the phylogenetic signal in extinction indicates that selection may have acted on traits not investigated here.},

  abstract = {The fossil record is spatiotemporally heterogeneous: taxon occurrence data have patchy spatial distributions, and this patchiness varies through time. Large-scale quantitative paleobiology studies that fail to account for heterogeneous sampling coverage will generate uninformative inferences at best and confidently draw wrong conclusions at worst. Explicitly spatial methods of standardization are necessary for analyses of large-scale fossil datasets, because nonspatial sample standardization, such as diversity rarefaction, is insufficient to reduce the signal of varying spatial coverage through time or between environments and clades. Spatial standardization should control both geographic area and dispersion (spread) of fossil localities. In addition to standardizing the spatial distribution of data, other factors may be standardized, including environmental heterogeneity or the number of publications or field collecting units that report taxon occurrences. Using a case study of published global Paleobiology Database occurrences, we demonstrate strong signals of sampling; without spatial standardization, these sampling signatures could be misattributed to biological processes. We discuss practical issues of implementing spatial standardization via subsampling and present the new R package divvy to improve the accessibility of spatial analysis. The software provides three spatial subsampling approaches, as well as related tools to quantify spatial coverage. After reviewing the theory, practice, and history of equalizing spatial coverage between data comparison groups, we outline priority areas to improve related data collection, analysis, and reporting practices in paleobiology.},

Here we investigate the extent to which quantile-based measures of relative dispersion can provide appropriate summary information as an alternative to the CV. In particular, we investigate two measures, the first being the interquartile range (in lieu of the standard deviation), divided by the median (in lieu of the mean), and the second being the median absolute deviation, divided by the median, as robust estimators of relative dispersion. In addition to comparing the influence functions of the competing estimators and their asymptotic biases and variances, we compare interval estimators using simulation studies to assess coverage.},

  abstract = {D. Jablonski [Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 99, 8139–8144 (2002)] coined the term “dead clades walking” (DCWs) to describe marine fossil orders that experience significant drops in genus richness during mass extinction events and never rediversify to previous levels. This phenomenon is generally interpreted as further evidence that the macroevolutionary consequences of mass extinctions can continue well past the formal boundary. It is unclear, however, exactly how long DCWs are expected to persist after extinction events and to what degree they impact broader trends in Phanerozoic biodiversity. Here we analyze the fossil occurrences of 134 skeletonized marine invertebrate orders in the Paleobiology Database (paleobiodb.org) using a Bayesian method to identify significant change points in genus richness. Our analysis identifies 70 orders that experience major diversity losses without recovery. Most of these taxa, however, do not fit the popular conception of DCWs as clades that narrowly survive a mass extinction event and linger for only a few stages before succumbing to extinction. The median postdrop duration of these DCW orders is long ({$>$}30 Myr), suggesting that previous studies may have underestimated the long-term taxonomic impact of mass extinction events. More importantly, many drops in diversity without recovery are not associated with mass extinction events and occur during background extinction stages. The prevalence of DCW orders throughout both mass and background extinction intervals and across phyla ({$>$}50\% of all marine invertebrate orders) suggests that the DCW pattern is a major component of macroevolutionary turnover.},

The formula and data together determine a numerical representation of the model from which the profiled deviance or the profiled REML criterion can be evaluated as a function of some of the model parameters. The appropriate criterion is optimized, using one of the constrained optimization functions in R, to provide the parameter estimates. We describe the structure of the model, the steps in evaluating the profiled deviance or REML criterion, and the structure of classes or types that represents such a model.

Palaeontological data may add valuable evidence from diversity distributions during intervals with different Earth system configurations, including potential analogues of future climate regimes. However, accurately characterizing these distributions is challenging because the geographic scope of fossil record coverage varies through time, introducing biases that have not been quantified by most previous studies. Here, we attempt a comprehensive documentation of latitudinal biodiversity distributions of marine invertebrates through the past 540 million years, explicitly accounting for regional variation in diversity and sampling. We demonstrate large uncertainties when using current fossil data at this scale. Nevertheless, some signals are detectable. We show that marine animal biodiversity declined with increasing palaeolatitude and with decreasing temperature during at least some intervals from the Permian onwards (298.9 Ma). Additionally, we find that the LBG was shallower on average when Earth's climate was hotter, although this signal is weak. We also document a strong, systematic bias due to intense sampling of the fossil record in North America and especially Europe, which may have led previous studies to incorrectly infer a mid-latitude diversity peak during warm intervals of Earth history. Our results provide a baseline for what current fossil databases might tell us about Phanerozoic LBGs of marine animals, and suggests that quantitative evaluation of uncertainties and systematic bias will be central to advancing knowledge of geographic variation in diversity through Earth's history.},

As such, the biological pump is critical in the partitioning of carbon dioxide between the ocean and atmosphere, and the rate at which that carbon can be sequestered through burial in marine sediments. How the structure and function of planktic ecosystems in the ocean govern the strength and efficiency of the biological pump and its resilience to disruption are poorly understood. The aftermath of the impact at the Cretaceous/Palaeogene (K/Pg) boundary provides an ideal opportunity to address these questions as both the biological pump and marine plankton size and diversity were fundamentally disrupted. The excellent fossil record of planktic foraminifera as indicators of pelagic-biotic recovery combined with carbon isotope records tracing biological pump behaviour, show that the recovery of ecological traits (diversity, size and photosymbiosis) occurred much later (approx. 4.3 Ma) than biological pump recovery (approx. 1.8 Ma). We interpret this decoupling of diversity and the biological pump as an indication that ecosystem function had sufficiently recovered to drive an effective biological pump, at least regionally in the South Atlantic.},

Here we review almost twenty biotic crises between the early Cambrian and end Cretaceous and explore potential causal mechanisms. Most extinctions are associated with global warming and proximal killers such as marine anoxia (including the Early/Middle Cambrian, the Late Ordovician, the intra-Silurian, intra-Devonian, end-Permian, and Early Jurassic crises). Many, but not all of these are accompanied by large negative carbon isotope excursions, supporting a volcanogenic origin. Most post-Silurian biocrises affected both terrestrial and marine biospheres, suggesting that atmospheric processes were crucial in driving global extinctions. Volcanogenic-atmospheric kill mechanisms include ocean acidification, toxic metal poisoning, acid rain, and ozone damage and consequent increased UV-B radiation, volcanic darkness, cooling and photosynthetic shutdown, each of which has been implicated in numerous events. Intriguingly, some of the most voluminous LIPs such as the oceanic plateaus of the Cretaceous were emplaced with minimal faunal losses and so volume of magma is not the only factor governing LIP lethality. The missing link might be continental configuration because the best examples of the LIP/extinction relationship occurred during the time of Pangaea. Many of the proximal kill mechanisms in LIP/extinction scenarios are also potential effects of bolide impact, including cooling, warming, acidification and ozone destruction. However, the absence of convincing temporal links between impacts and extinctions other than the Chicxulub-Cretaceous example, suggests that impacts are not the main driver of extinctions. With numerous competing extinction scenarios, and the realisation that some of the purported environmental stresses may once again be driving mass extinction, we explore how experimental biology might inform our understanding of ancient extinctions as well as future crises.},

  abstract = {The end-Permian mass extinction removed more than 80\% of marine genera. Ammonoid cephalopods were among the organisms most affected by this crisis. The analysis of a global diversity data set of ammonoid genera covering about 106 million years centered on the Permian-Triassic boundary (PTB) shows that Triassic ammonoids actually reached levels of diversity higher than in the Permian less than 2 million years after the PTB. The data favor a hierarchical rather than logistic model of diversification coupled with a niche incumbency hypothesis. This explosive and nondelayed diversification contrasts with the slow and delayed character of the Triassic biotic recovery as currently illustrated for other, mainly benthic groups such as bivalves and gastropods.},

It can also be used as a basis for listing species as endangered under World Conservation Union criteria5. However, there is considerable scepticism regarding the predictive accuracy of PVA, mainly because of a lack of validation in real systems2,6,7,8. Here we conducted a retrospective test of PVA based on 21 long-term ecological studies—the first comprehensive and replicated evaluation of the predictive powers of PVA. Parameters were estimated from the first half of each data set and the second half was used to evaluate the performance of the model. Contrary to recent criticisms, we found that PVA predictions were surprisingly accurate. The risk of population decline closely matched observed outcomes, there was no significant bias, and population size projections did not differ significantly from reality. Furthermore, the predictions of the five PVA software packages were highly concordant. We conclude that PVA is a valid and sufficiently accurate tool for categorizing and managing endangered species.},

However, the relationship between these variables and extinction risk has not been tested extensively during evolutionarily “quiescent” times of low extinction and speciation in the fossil record. Here we examine the influence of geographic range size and abundance on extinction risk during the late Paleozoic (Mississippian–Permian), a time of “sluggish” evolution when global rates of origination and extinction were roughly half those of other Paleozoic intervals. Analyses used spatiotemporal occurrences for 164 brachiopod species from the North American midcontinent. We found abundance to be a better predictor of extinction risk than measures of geographic range size. Moreover, species exhibited reductions in abundance before their extinction but did not display contractions in geographic range size. The weak relationship between geographic range size and extinction in this time and place may reflect the relative preponderance of larger-ranged taxa combined with the physiographic conditions of the region that allowed for easy habitat tracking that dampened both extinction and speciation. These conditions led to a prolonged period (19–25 Myr) during which standard macroevolutionary rules did not apply.},

Intense debate has focused on the relative roles of Deccan volcanism and the Chicxulub asteroid impact as kill mechanisms for this event. Here, we combine fossil-occurrence data with paleoclimate and habitat suitability models to evaluate dinosaur habitability in the wake of various asteroid impact and Deccan volcanism scenarios. Asteroid impact models generate a prolonged cold winter that suppresses potential global dinosaur habitats. Conversely, long-term forcing from Deccan volcanism (carbon dioxide [CO2]-induced warming) leads to increased habitat suitability. Short-term (aerosol cooling) volcanism still allows equatorial habitability. These results support the asteroid impact as the main driver of the non-avian dinosaur extinction. By contrast, induced warming from volcanism mitigated the most extreme effects of asteroid impact, potentially reducing the extinction severity.},

Species’ trajectories towards extinction are shaped by multiple factors, including life-history traits2 as well as human pressures3. Previous studies linking these factors to extinction risk have been narrow in their taxonomic and geographic scope4, thus limiting the ability for identifying global predictors. We studied the relation between 12 traits and the extinction risk of almost 900 species representing 15 groups across the tree of life (vertebrates, invertebrates and plants) at a global scale. We show that threatened species share narrow habitat breadth, poor dispersal ability, low fecundity, small altitudinal range, and are affected by a large human footprint. Other traits either show contrasting responses among groups (body size, offspring size, and change in human footprint), or relations were found for only a limited number of taxa (generation length, diet breadth, microhabitat). Our study suggests that in the absence of data on the precise distribution and population trends of species, traits can be used as predictors of extinction risk and thus help guide future research, monitoring and conservation efforts.},

  abstract = {Snails are model organisms for studying the genetic, molecular, and developmental bases of left–right asymmetry in Bilateria. However, the development of their typical helicospiral shell, present for the last 540 million years in environments as different as the abyss or our gardens, remains poorly understood. Conversely, ammonites typically have a bilaterally symmetric, planispiraly coiled shell, with only 1\% of 3,000 genera displaying either a helicospiral or a meandering asymmetric shell. A comparative analysis suggests that the development of chiral shells in these mollusks is different and that, unlike snails, ammonites with asymmetric shells probably had a bilaterally symmetric body diagnostic of cephalopods. We propose a mathematical model for the growth of shells, taking into account the physical interaction during development between the soft mollusk body and its hard shell. Our model shows that a growth mismatch between the secreted shell tube and a bilaterally symmetric body in ammonites can generate mechanical forces that are balanced by a twist of the body, breaking shell symmetry. In gastropods, where a twist is intrinsic to the body, the same model predicts that helicospiral shells are the most likely shell forms. Our model explains a large diversity of forms and shows that, although molluscan shells are incrementally secreted at their opening, the path followed by the shell edge and the resulting form are partly governed by the mechanics of the body inside the shell, a perspective that explains many aspects of their development and evolution.},

  abstract = {Measuring the metabolic rate of marine animals in their natural environment is challenging, impeding our understanding of their physiological ecology. Recently, a novel metabolic proxy, namely the δ13C values of biogenic carbonates (otoliths), was experimentally validated in teleost fishes. Cephalopods possess several types of biogenic carbonates, such as statolith, cuttlebone and other internal and external shells, which are all potential metabolic recorders, but few have been evaluated. To test the feasibility of the δ13C metabolic proxy in cephalopods, we conducted a temperature-controlled experiment with the pharaoh cuttlefish Sepia pharaonis to assess whether the proportion of metabolically derived carbon (Cresp) incorporated into statoliths and cuttlebones increases with metabolism in a warm environment. Moreover, we conducted multiple-species analysis using the published δ13C values of various biogenic carbonates to evaluate the consistency of the proxy among cephalopod species and between cephalopods and teleost fishes. In the temperature-controlled laboratory experiment, Cresp values calculated from statoliths and cuttlebones increased with an increase in environmental temperature. Cresp values did not differ between statoliths and cuttlebones. Moreover, the Cresp values of cephalopod biogenic carbonates had a similar range to those of fish otoliths and were correlated with metabolism-related factors, such as ambient temperature, body mass, ontogeny and functional behaviours, strengthening the feasibility of their use. The δ13C metabolic proxy reflects the total energy use in the natural environment, and it can be transformed into the oxygen consumption rate for a broader comparison with other species and for further evaluation with current theories related to metabolic ecology. However, experimental validation is highly recommended because the relationship between the oxygen consumption rate and Cresp values derived from biogenic carbonates of cephalopods might be structure- and species-specific. Our study revealed that the newly developed metabolic proxy provides a valuable alternative approach to study ecophysiology in cephalopods, and further development might broaden its applicability. \hspace{0pt}},

Compared to existing works, our approach allows us to determine the morphological transitions of the elastic plate without prescribing the underlying target metric of the unstressed state of the elastic body. We explicitly solve the derived FvK equations in some physical problems of engineering interest, discussing how the initial stress distribution drives the emergence of spontaneous curvatures within the deformed plate. The proposed mathematical framework can be used to tailor shape on demand, with applications in several engineering fields ranging from soft robotics to four-dimensional printing.},

  abstract = {There is no consensus about how terrestrial biodiversity was assembled through deep time, and in particular whether it has risen exponentially over the Phanerozoic. Using a database of 60 859 fossil occurrences, we show that the spatial extent of the worldwide terrestrial tetrapod fossil record itself expands exponentially through the Phanerozoic. Changes in spatial sampling explain up to 67\% of the change in known fossil species counts, and these changes are decoupled from variation in habitable land area that existed through time. Spatial sampling therefore represents a real and profound sampling bias that cannot be explained as redundancy. To address this bias, we estimate terrestrial tetrapod diversity for palaeogeographical regions of approximately equal size. We find that regional-scale diversity was constrained over timespans of tens to hundreds of millions of years, and similar patterns are recovered for major subgroups, such as dinosaurs, mammals and squamates. Although the Cretaceous/Palaeogene mass extinction catalysed an abrupt two- to three-fold increase in regional diversity 66 million years ago, no further increases occurred, and recent levels of regional diversity do not exceed those of the Palaeogene. These results parallel those recovered in analyses of local community-level richness.

The ammonite was swallowed by the fish, likely by accident, and represents the first direct evidence for an actinopterygian fish consuming an ammonoid. Exceptional aragonite preservation of the conch retaining partial nacreous lustre, combined with only minor acid etching of the shell, strongly indicates that the ammonite was ingested immediately prior to and was directly responsible for the fish’s death.

However, the kinds of ammonoids that were more likely to survive the PTME and that fueled subsequent diversification are still poorly known. We compiled a comprehensive morphological data set and used the nonmetric multidimensional scaling method to reveal the impact of the PTME on the morphological selectivity of ammonoids. Our results show that postextinction taxa occupied a quite different morphospace when compared with the pre-extinction assemblages. The survivors were mainly smooth and weakly ornamented forms, while the late Permian species were dominated by coarsely ornamented forms. Contrary to previously recognized nonselective patterns, these results suggest a morphological selectivity of the Permian-Triassic crisis. Newcomers in the Griesbachian were mainly compressed and smooth forms. This morphological shift from the coarsely ornamented ammonoids dominating the Changhsingian to the smooth ammonoids dominating the Griesbachian possibly suggests an ecological turnover of ammonoids during the PTME.},

Studies examining links between range size and extinction risk may also offer a predictive tool for identifying species most vulnerable in the “sixth mass extinction.” However, the extent to which paleogeographic ranges can be recorded reliably in the fossil record is unknown. We perform simulation-based extinction experiments to examine (1) the fidelity of paleogeographic range size preservation in deep time, (2) the relative performance of different methods for reconstructing range size, and (3) the reliability of detecting patterns of extinction “selectivity” on range size. Our results suggest both that relative paleogeographic range size can be consistently reconstructed and that selectivity patterns on range size can be preserved under many extinction intensities, even when sedimentary rocks are scarce. By identifying patterns of selectivity across Earth’s history, paleontologists can thus augment neontological work that aims to predict and prevent extinctions of living species. Last, we find that introducing “false extinctions” in the fossil record can produce spurious range-selectivity signals. Errors in the temporal ranges of species may pose a larger barrier to reconstructing range size–extinction risk signals than the spatial distribution of fossiliferous sediments.},

However, no attempts have been made to establish how accurately range sizes and range-size dynamics can be preserved. Two fundamental questions are: Can common paleo range-size reconstruction methods accurately reproduce known species’ ranges from locality (i.e., point) data? And, are some reconstruction methods more reliable than others? Here, we develop a methodological framework for testing the accuracy of commonly used paleo range-size reconstruction methods (maximum latitudinal range, maximum great-circle distance, convex hull, and alpha convex hull) in different extinction-related biogeographic scenarios. We use the current distribution of surface water bodies as a proxy for “preservable area,” in which to test the performance of the four methods. We find that maximum great-circle distance and convex-hull methods most reliably capture changes in range size at low numbers of fossil sites, whereas convex hull performs best at predicting the distribution of “victims” and “survivors” in hypothetical extinction scenarios. Our results suggest that macroevolutionary and macroecological patterns in the relatively recent past can be studied reliably using only a few fossil occurrence sites. The accuracy of range-size reconstruction undoubtedly changes through time with the distribution and area of fossiliferous sediments; however, our approach provides the opportunity to systematically calibrate the quality of the spatial fossil record in specific environments and time intervals, and to delineate the conditions under which paleobiologists can reconstruct paleobiogeographical, macroecological, and macroevolutionary patterns over critical intervals in Earth history.},

  abstract = {Ecologists are increasingly using the fossil record of mass extinction to build predictive models for the ongoing biodiversity crisis. During mass extinctions, major depletions in global (i.e., gamma) diversity may reflect decrease in alpha diversity (i.e., local assemblages support fewer taxa), and/or decrease in beta diversity (such that similar pools of taxa are common to a greater number of local areas). Contrasting the effects of extinction on alpha and beta diversity is therefore central to understanding how global richness becomes depleted over these critical events. Here we investigate the spatial effects of mass extinction by examining changes in alpha, beta, and gamma diversity in brachiopod communities over both pulses of Ordovician-Silurian extinction ( 445.2 and 438.8 million years ago), which had dramatically different causal mechanisms. We furthermore reconstruct geographic range sizes for brachiopod genera to test competing models for drivers of beta diversity change. We find that: (1) alpha and beta diversity respond differently to extinction; (2) these responses differ between pulses of extinction; (3) changes in beta diversity associated with extinction are accompanied by changes in geographic range size; and (4) changes in global beta diversity were driven by the extinction of taxa with statistically small and large ranges, rather than range expansion/contraction in taxa that survive into the aftermath. A symptom of ongoing biotic crisis may therefore be the extinction of specific narrow- or wide-ranging taxa, rather than the global proliferation of opportunistic and “disaster” forms. In addition, our results illustrate that changes in beta diversity on these longer timescales may largely be dictated by emplacement and removal of barriers to dispersal. Lastly, this study reinforces the utility of the fossil record in addressing questions surrounding the role of global-scale processes (such as mass extinctions) in sculpting and assembling regional biotas.},

  abstract = {During the Devonian Nekton Revolution, ammonoids show a progressive coiling of their shell just like many other pelagic mollusk groups. These now extinct, externally shelled cephalopods derived from bactritoid cephalopods with a straight shell in the Early Devonian. During the Devonian, evolutionary trends toward tighter coiling and a size reduction occurred in ammonoid embryonic shells. In at least three lineages, descendants with a closed umbilicus evolved convergently from forms with an opening in the first whorl (umbilical window). Other lineages having representatives with open umbilici became extinct around important Devonian events whereas only those with more tightly coiled embryonic shells survived. This change was accompanied by an evolutionary trend in shape of the initial chamber, but no clear trend in its size. The fact that several ammonoid lineages independently reduced and closed the umbilical window more or less synchronously indicates that common driving factors were involved. A trend in size decrease of the embryos as well as the concurrent increase in adult size in some lineages likely reflects a fundamental change in reproductive strategies toward a higher fecundity early in the evolutionary history of ammonoids. This might have played an important role in their subsequent success as well as in their demise.},

The evolutionary transitions from prokaryotes to unicellular eukaryotes to metazoans were accompanied by major innovations in metabolic design. Here we show that the scalings of metabolic rate, population growth rate, and production efficiency with body size have changed across the evolutionary transitions. Metabolic rate scales with body mass superlinearly in prokaryotes, linearly in protists, and sublinearly in metazoans, so Kleiber’s 3/4 power scaling law does not apply universally across organisms. The scaling of maximum population growth rate shifts from positive in prokaryotes to negative in protists and metazoans, and the efficiency of production declines across these groups. Major changes in metabolic processes during the early evolution of life overcame existing constraints, exploited new opportunities, and imposed new constraints.},

Here, we help to resolve this by describing a rapidly emplaced, high-energy onshore surge deposit from the terrestrial Hell Creek Formation in Montana. Associated ejecta and a cap of iridium-rich impactite reveal that its emplacement coincided with the Chicxulub event. Acipenseriform fish, densely packed in the deposit, contain ejecta spherules in their gills and were buried by an inland-directed surge that inundated a deeply incised river channel before accretion of the fine-grained impactite. Although this deposit displays all of the physical characteristics of a tsunami runup, the timing ({$<$}1 hour postimpact) is instead consistent with the arrival of strong seismic waves from the magnitude Mw ∼10 to 11 earthquake generated by the Chicxulub impact, identifying a seismically coupled seiche inundation as the likely cause. Our findings present high-resolution chronology of the immediate aftereffects of the Chicxulub impact event in the Western Interior, and report an impact-triggered onshore mix of marine and terrestrial sedimentation—potentially a significant advancement for eventually resolving both the complex dynamics of debris ejection and the full nature and extent of biotic disruptions that took place in the first moments postimpact.},

We observe a tight correlation between the metabolic rate and~the efficacy of oxygen supply, and between~the temperature sensitivities of these traits, which suggests that marine animals are under strong selection for the tolerance of~low O2 (hypoxia)5. The breadth of the resulting physiological tolerances of marine animals predicts a variety of geographical niches—from the tropics to high latitudes and from shallow to deep water—which better align with species distributions than do models based on either temperature or oxygen alone. For all studied species, thermal and hypoxic limits are substantially reduced by the energetic demands of ecological activity, a trait that varies similarly among marine and terrestrial taxa. Active temperature-dependent hypoxia thus links the biogeography of diverse marine species to fundamental energetic requirements that are shared across the animal kingdom.},

Since simple dimensional analysis suggests α=2/3, we consider this to be a null hypothesis testable by empirical studies. We re-analyse data sets for mammals and birds compiled by Heusner, Bennett and Harvey, Bartels, Hemmingsen, Brody, and Kleiber, and find little evidence for rejecting α=2/3 in favor ofα =3/4. For mammals, we find a possible breakdown in scaling for larger masses reflected in a systematic increase in α. We also review theoretical justifications of α=3/4 based on dimensional analysis, nutrient-supply networks, and four-dimensional biology. We find that present theories for α=3/4 require assumptions that render them unconvincing for rejecting the null hypothesis that α=2/3.},

  abstract = {The varying body chamber lengths and the different attachment of muscles and mantle to conch wall belong to the major adaptations to their diverse modes of locomotion. Therefore, these traits are indirect indicators of different life styles. The sparse record of ammonoid body chamber lengths and attachment marks has impeded the understanding of this aspect of ammonoid paleobiology. The examination of body chamber length revealed that the decrease of the ammonitella body chamber lengths shows is the long-term trend characterizing the evolutionary development of the Goniatitida–Prolecanitida–Ceratitida–Phylloceratida branch of the Ammonoidea. The analysis of the body chamber lengths and the attachment marks leads to conclusion that a precondition for the jet-powered swimming of ammonoids is less than one whorl body chamber length and the position of the attachment marks in sites from where the cephalic retractor and funnel retractor muscles would be able to extend straight across to the head and to the funnel. This is the case of goniatitids and ammonitids possessing moved forward large ventrolateral muscle marks; jet-powered swimming is highly probable for them. None of the universal small dorsal, umbilical and ventral marks may be left in the attachment sites of the cephalic retractor and funnel retractor muscles. In the hook-shaped terminal body chambers of heteromorph ammonoids, like Audouliceras, the long tongue-like umbilical marks perhaps indicate the moved forward strong umbilical muscles adapted for regular change of the mantle cavity volume for sucking and filtering seawater. This suggests that such ammonoids fed on fine plankton or suspended organic rich substance. Their irregular coiled spiral shells, best suited to floating and perhaps vertical (diurnal) migrations, support the view above. The fossilized mantle so far described in the ceratitid ammonoid Austrotrachyceras has a laminated structure fibrous seen in internally shelled Jurassic belemnotheutis and Loligosaepia.},

Yet, the relative role of temperature versus acidification, and the ability of resultant ecosystems to retain core services such as coastal protection, are less clear. Here, we investigate changes to the net chemical balances of calcium carbonate within complex experimental coral reefs over 18 months under conditions projected for 2100 if CO2 emissions continue unmitigated. We reveal a decoupling of calcifier biomass and calcification under the synergistic impact of warming and acidification, that combined with increased night-time dissolution, leads to an accelerated loss of carbonate frameworks. Climate change induced degradation will limit the ability of coral reefs to keep-up with sea level rise, possibly for thousands of years. We conclude that instead of simply transitioning to alternate states that are capable of buffering coastlines, reefs are at risk of drowning leading to critical losses in ecosystem functions.},

These Mesozoic hyperthermals were responsible for the mass extinction of marine organisms and resulted in significant ecological upheaval. It has, however, been suggested that these events merely involved intensification of background extinction rates rather than significant shifts in the macroevolutionary regime and extinction selectivity. Here, we apply a multivariate modelling approach to a vast global database of marine organisms to test whether extinction selectivity varied through the Late Triassic and Early Jurassic. We show that these hyperthermals do represent shifts in the macroevolutionary regime and record different extinction selectivity compared to background intervals of the Late Triassic and Early Jurassic. The Late Triassic mass extinction represents a more profound change in selectivity than the Early Toarcian extinction but both events show a common pattern of selecting against pelagic predators and benthic photosymbiotic and suspension-feeding organisms, suggesting that these groups of organisms may be particularly vulnerable during episodes of global warming. In particular, the Late Triassic extinction represents a macroevolutionary regime change that is characterized by (i) the change in extinction selectivity between Triassic background intervals and the extinction event itself; and (ii) the differences in extinction selectivity between the Late Triassic and Early Jurassic as a whole.},

  abstract = {Fossil specimens can be recovered easily only from exposed localities, so rock exposure area should represent a better proxy for rock availability than the frequently used outcrop (i.e., map) area. Data collected via remote sensing and GIS show that map area does not consistently correlate with exposure area in different regions. Proportional rock exposure is not geographically consistent and is influenced by a number of variables that are independent of outcrop area, including proximity to the coast, elevation, bedrock age, land use and lithology. These variables appear to be non-independent in their influence on rock exposure, and are not consistent in their effects across continents. The inconsistency in the correlation between outcrop and exposure area, and the variability in the influence of different factors on rock exposure, suggests that using outcrop area as a sampling proxy is poorly supported. The weaknesses in using outcrop area as a sampling proxy, highlighted by the lack of correlation with exposure area, suggest that a single accurate global sampling proxy may never be attained and it is premature to assume that paleodiversity curves can be corrected using such proxies. It is therefore preferable to work on a regional scale, comparing regional fossil collection data with a number of proxies representing all aspects of sampling. The lack of correlation between outcrop and exposure area suggests that the covariance detected between outcrop area and paleodiversity might be better explained by a common-cause model, and that geological megabiases may not have had as profound an effect on paleodiversity curves as previously thought.}

Recent studies have proposed the use of stable carbon and oxygen isotopes (δ13C and δ18O) in biogenic carbonates as proxies of metabolic rate and experienced temperature, respectively, to overcome the challenges of directly measuring these data in the field. Our study represents the first experimental investigation to develop δ13C and δ18O proxies in octopus. Octopus berrima hatchlings were raised in captivity, at varying water temperatures, for up to 110 days. O. berrima statoliths were then subsequently analysed for δ13C and δ18O values. The proportion of metabolically derived carbon, or respired carbon (Cresp), increased as the octopus grew (slope~=~0.076, R2~=~0.72), suggesting an influence of somatic growth rate and body mass on δ13C values. Additionally, we identified an inverse correlation between δ18O values and environmental temperature (slope~=~−0.163, R2~=~0.91), which was subsequently used to develop a thermal reconstruction model. Our experiment aids in interpreting stable isotopic values in statoliths and their application as temperature and metabolic proxies in wild-caught octopus. Such proxies will increase our monitoring capabilities of these ecologically and commercially significant cephalopods and contribute to their conservation and effective management.},

Their rich fossil record is an important testing ground for macroecological and macroevolutionary theory, but much of this historical biodiversity remains locked away in consolidated sediments. Manually preparing invertebrate fossils out of their matrix can require weeks to months of careful excavation and cannot guarantee the recovery of important features on specimens. Micro-CT is greatly improving our access to the morphologies of these fossils, but it remains difficult to digitally separate specimens from sediments of similar compositions, e.g., calcareous shells in a carbonate rich matrix. Here we provide a workflow for using deep learning—a subset of machine learning based on artificial neural networks—to augment the segmentation of these difficult fossils. We also provide a guide for bulk scanning fossil and Recent shells, with sizes ranging from 1 mm to 20 cm, enabling the rapid acquisition of large-scale 3D datasets for macroevolutionary and macroecological analyses (300–500 shells in 8 hours of scanning). We then illustrate how these approaches have been used to access new dimensions of morphology, allowing rigorous statistical testing of spatial and temporal patterns in morphological evolution, which open novel research directions in the history of life.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Major shifts in ecological dominance are one of the most conspicuous but poorly understood features of the fossil record. Here we examine one of the most prominent such shifts, the Ordovician shift from trilobite to brachiopod dominance of benthic ecosystems. Using an integrated database of high-resolution paleoecological samples and body size data, we show that while the average local richness and relative abundance of trilobites declined significantly through the Ordovician, the estimated standing biomass of trilobites, and by implication the amount of energy that they used, remained relatively invariant. This is attributable to an increase in the average body size of trilobite species in our data set, and especially to the widespread occurrence of the exceptionally large Middle–Late Ordovician trilobite genus Isotelus. Brachiopods increase in both mean body size and relative abundance throughout the Ordovician, so that estimates of brachiopod biomass and energetic use increase substantially between the Early and Late Ordovician. Although the data set includes a range of depositional environments, similar trends are observed in both shallow subtidal and deep subtidal settings. These results suggest that diversification of the Paleozoic Fauna did not come at the energetic expense of the Cambrian Fauna. The declining relative abundance of trilobites may reflect a combination of numerical dilution and the necessary energetic trade-offs between body size and abundance.},

Although it has been suggested that the MMR marks an increase in the average energy consumption of marine animal ecosystems, this hypothesis has not been evaluated quantitatively. In this study, we integrate body size and abundance data from the fossil record with physiological data from living representatives to estimate mean per capita metabolic rates of tropical to subtropical assemblages of shallow-marine gastropods—a major component of marine ecosystems throughout the Meso-Cenozoic—both before and after the MMR. We find that mean per capita metabolic rate rose by ∼150\% between the Late Triassic and Late Cretaceous and remained relatively stable thereafter. The most important factor governing the increase in metabolic rate was an increase in mean body size. In principle, this size increase could result from secular changes in sampling and taphonomic biases, but these biases are suggested to yield decreases rather than increases in mean size. Considering that post-MMR gastropod diversity is dominated by predators, the net primary production required to supply the energetic needs of the average individual increased by substantially more than 150\%. These data support the hypothesis that benthic energy budgets increased during the MMR, possibly in response to rising primary productivity.},

Many studies devote significant attention to cleaning fossil occurrence data prior to analysis, but such efforts are typically bespoke and difficult to reproduce. There are also no standardised methods to detect and resolve errors despite the development of an ecosystem of cleaning tools fuelled by the concurrent growth of neontological occurrence databases. As fossil occurrence databases continue to increase in size, the demand for standardised, automated and reproducible methods to improve data quality will only grow. Here, we present semi-automated cleaning solutions to address these issues with a new R package fossilbrush. We apply our cleaning protocols to the Paleobiology Database to assess the prevalence of anomalous entries and the efficacy and impact of our methods. We find that anomalies may be effectively resolved by comparison against a published compendium of stratigraphic ranges, improving the stratigraphic quality of the data, and through methods which detect outliers in taxon-wise occurrence stratigraphic distributions. Despite this, anomalous entries remain prevalent throughout major clades, with often more than 30\% of genera in major fossil groups (e.g. bivalves, echinoderms) displaying stratigraphically suspect occurrence records. Our methods provide a way to flag and resolve anomalous taxonomic data before downstream palaeobiological analysis and may also aid in the automation and targeting of future cleaning efforts. We stress, however, that our methods are semi-automated and are primarily for the detection of potential anomalies for further scrutiny, as full automation should not be a substitute for expert vetting. We note that some of our methods do not rely on external databases for anomaly resolution and so are also applicable to occurrences in neontological databases, expanding the utility of the fossilbrush R package.},

Advances in our understanding of the spatial distribution of the fossil record through geological time, however, has demonstrated that global trends in biodiversity were a mosaic of regionally heterogeneous diversification processes. Drivers of diversification must presumably have also displayed regional variation to produce the spatial disparities observed in past taxonomic richness. Here, we analyse the fossil record of ammonoids, pelagic shelled cephalopods, through the Late Cretaceous, characterised by some palaeontologists as an interval of biotic decline prior to their total extinction at the Cretaceous-Paleogene boundary. We regionally subdivide this record to eliminate the impacts of spatial sampling biases and infer regional origination and extinction rates corrected for temporal sampling biases using Bayesian methods. We then model these rates using biotic and abiotic drivers commonly inferred to influence diversification. Ammonoid diversification dynamics and responses to this common set of diversity drivers were regionally heterogeneous, do not support ecological decline, and demonstrate that their global diversification signal is influenced by spatial disparities in sampling effort. These results call into question the feasibility of seeking drivers of diversity at global scales in the fossil record.},

This commonality presents a key question: can the extinction risk of species during past mass extinction events inform our predictions for a modern biodiversity crisis? To investigate if it is possible to establish which species were more likely to go extinct during mass extinctions, we applied a functional trait-based model of extinction risk using a machine learning algorithm to datasets of marine fossils for the end-Permian, end-Triassic and end-Cretaceous mass extinctions. Extinction selectivity was inferred across each individual mass extinction event, before testing whether the selectivity patterns obtained could be used to ‘predict’ the extinction selectivity exhibited during the other mass extinctions. Our analyses show that, despite some similarities in extinction selectivity patterns between ancient crises, the selectivity of mass extinction events is inconsistent, which leads to a poor predictive performance. This lack of predictability is attributed to evolution in marine ecosystems, particularly during the Mesozoic Marine Revolution, associated with shifts in community structure alongside coincident Earth system changes. Our results suggest that past extinctions are unlikely to be informative for predicting extinction risk during a projected mass extinction.},

  abstract = {Investigation of known Seguin localities led to the discovery of an overlooked diverse and abundant marine fauna in Solomon's Branch, a stream in Bastrop County, Texas. The fauna, a transported assemblage from a marine littoral environment, encompasses a mix of specimen types from large wave-worn individuals to the smallest unworn ornamented species. Following the discovery of this fauna, further field work was undertaken and other Seguin localities with different depositional environments were found and collections made from those sites. Finally, a further suite of specimens was examined within the Texas Natural Science Center, some from localities no longer in existence or now lost. The environment is transitional in character from the deeper water Midway to the nonmarine environment of the chiefly terrestrial Texas Wilcox deposits, and represents the last major marine transgression in this area prior to the Eocene. The fauna is a mix of that derived from early Paleocene and Cretaceous taxa as well as elements that appear to originate from western Africa, the Tethyan region, and the western coast of America. The inferred species' habitat includes a near-shore open marine element, a probable lagoonal component, and brackish water elements.

  abstract = {In this review I show that the ‘3/4-power scaling law’ of metabolic rate is not universal, either within or among animal species. Significant variation in the scaling of metabolic rate with body mass is described mainly for animals, but also for unicells and plants. Much of this variation, which can be related to taxonomic, physiological, and/or environmental differences, is not adequately explained by existing theoretical models, which are also reviewed. As a result, synthetic explanatory schemes based on multiple boundary constraints and on the scaling of multiple energy-using processes are advocated. It is also stressed that a complete understanding of metabolic scaling will require the identification of both proximate (functional)and ultimate (evolutionary)causes. Four major types of intraspecific metabolic scaling with body mass are recognized [based on the power function R=aMb, where R is respiration (metabolic) rate, a is a constant, M is body mass, and b is the scaling exponent]: Type I: linear, negatively allometric (b {$<$}1); Type II: linear, isometric (b=1); Type III: nonlinear, ontogenetic shift from isometric (b=1), or nearly isometric, to negatively allometric (b {$<$}1); and Type IV: nonlinear, ontogenetic shift from positively allometric (b {$>$} 1) to one or two later phases of negative allometry (b {$<$}1). Ontogenetic changes in the metabolic intensity of four component processes (i.e.growth, reproduction, locomotion, and heat production) appear to be important in these different patterns of metabolic scaling. These changes may, in turn, be shaped by age (size)-specific patterns of mortality. In addition, major differences in interspecific metabolic scaling are described, especially with respect to mode of temperature regulation, body-size range, and activity level. A‘metabolic-level boundaries hypothesis’ focusing on two major constraints (surface-area limits on resource/waste exchange processes and mass/volume limits on power production) can explain much, but not all of this variation. My analysis indicates that further empirical and theoretical work is needed to understand fully the physiological and ecological bases for the considerable variation in metabolic scaling that is observed both within and among species.Recommended approaches for doing this are discussed. I conclude that the scaling of metabolism is not the simple result of a physical law, but rather appears to be the more complex result of diverse adaptations evolved in the context of both physico-chemical and ecological constraints.},

Key findings as reviewed here are: (1) the confirmation of acoustic fluidization as a physical principle to explain impact structure formation; (2) the importance of the target rock properties and marine setting for impactite depositional processes and drivers of climate change; (3) the state of understanding of extinction mechanisms and ecological recovery; and (4) implications for impact-generated hydrothermal habitat creation. Areas highlighted for the next stages of discovery include: (1) physics and chemistry of impact vapour plumes and ejecta processes; (2) sampling of the K–Pg boundary deposit and impact melt sheet within the central basin of the impact structure; (3) examination of ecosystem recovery in an ‘Early Ocean’ scenario at a range of K–Pg boundary sites; and (4) experiments and observations of impact hydrothermal systems as habitats on Earth and other worlds.},

Taphonomic and sedimentary features reveal that the Eocene nautiloids were parautochthonous whereas the Miocene species might have been transported post-mortally for some distance. Palaeobiogeographic distribution of the Cenozoic nautiloids of the Indian subcontinent and other parts of the world reveals that though the genera are pandemic the species are often endemic to a basin or a province. Specific endemism and pattern of broad faunal similarity of nautiloids among different provinces within the Tethys Realm (sensu Harzhauser et al., 2002) mimic those of the benthic molluscs during the Palaeogene.},

Species can be rare in markedly different ways, but the relative impacts of these different forms of rarity on extinction risk are poorly known and cannot be determined through observations of species that are not yet extinct. The fossil record provides a valuable archive with which we can directly determine which aspects of rarity lead to the greatest risk. Previous palaeontological analyses confirm that rarity is associated with extinction risk, but the relative contributions of different types of rarity to extinction risk remain unknown because their impacts have never been examined simultaneously. Here, we analyse a global database of fossil marine animals spanning the past 500 million years, examining differential extinction with respect to multiple rarity types within each geological stage. We observe systematic differences in extinction risk over time among marine genera classified according to their rarity. Geographic range played a primary role in determining extinction, and habitat breadth a secondary role, whereas local abundance had little effect. These results suggest that current reductions in geographic range size will lead to pronounced increases in long-term extinction risk even if local populations are relatively large at present.},

Soft-bodied Cambrian arthropods show both statistically larger geographic ranges and greater stratigraphic longevities than co-occurring trilobites.

  abstract = {Mass extinction at the Cretaceous–Paleogene (K-Pg) boundary coincides with the Chicxulub bolide impact and also falls within the broader time frame of Deccan trap emplacement. Critically, though, empirical evidence as to how either of these factors could have driven observed extinction patterns and carbon cycle perturbations is still lacking. Here, using boron isotopes in foraminifera, we document a geologically rapid surface-ocean pH drop following the Chicxulub impact, supporting impact-induced ocean acidification as a mechanism for ecological collapse in the marine realm. Subsequently, surface water pH rebounded sharply with the extinction of marine calcifiers and the associated imbalance in the global carbon cycle. Our reconstructed water-column pH gradients, combined with Earth system modeling, indicate that a partial ∼50\% reduction in global marine primary productivity is sufficient to explain observed marine carbon isotope patterns at the K-Pg, due to the underlying action of the solubility pump. While primary productivity recovered within a few tens of thousands of years, inefficiency in carbon export to the deep sea lasted much longer. This phased recovery scenario reconciles competing hypotheses previously put forward to explain the K-Pg carbon isotope records, and explains both spatially variable patterns of change in marine productivity across the event and a lack of extinction at the deep sea floor. In sum, we provide insights into the drivers of the last mass extinction, the recovery of marine carbon cycling in a postextinction world, and the way in which marine life imprints its isotopic signal onto the geological record.},

  abstract = {Reconstructing marine paleoenvironments from the skeletal hardparts of nektic organisms is often hampered by their unknown migrational pathways involving different water masses and their corresponding physico-chemical parameters. Despite significant progress over the last years, the reconstruction of migration patterns of extinct ammonoids is difficult because both, vertical and horizontal ones lead to an intricate combination of reconstructed seawater temperatures. Paleonvironmental data retrieved from exceptionally well-preserved lower Albian (Douvilleiceras mammillatum ammonite zone, uppermost CC8a nannofossil zone, 110.5–111.0\,Ma) cephalopod shells from Madagascar (Mahajanga Basin, 40–42° southern latitude) are reconstructed based on a novel multi-proxy approach. Here we combine and contrast: (i) nacre tablet-paleobathymetry, (ii) Westermann Morphospace, and (iii) shell isotope geochemistry analysis. Results obtained allow for a robust reconstruction of habitat depth, paleo-seawater temperatures, and paleoecology of extinct cephalopod taxa. The discocone nautiloid Cymatoceras is regarded as vertical migrant with a maximum habitat depth of 250\,m and a mean habitat water temperature of 20–21\,°C. All three ammonoid taxa (Cleoniceras, Desmoceras, and Eogaudryceras) share a platycone to planorbicone shell shape suggesting a demersal life habit at maximal water depths of 450–500\,m and temperatures of 19–21\,°C for Cleoniceras and Desmoceras, and the deepest (525\,m) and coolest (14\,°C) habitat for Eogaudryceras. Circumstantial evidence from benthic mollusk shells from the same stratigraphic interval as well as sedimentological and paleopathological data provide further support for habitat reconstructions. Reconstructed paleotemperatures shown here provide well-constrained evidence for the thermal structure of past oceanic water masses and have significance for Cretaceous paleoceanography in general.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT Heteromorphs are ammonoids forming a conch with detached whorls (open coiling) or non-planispiral coiling. Such aberrant forms appeared convergently four times within this extinct group of cephalopods. Since Wiedmann's seminal paper in this journal, the palaeobiology of heteromorphs has advanced substantially. Combining direct evidence from their fossil record, indirect insights from phylogenetic bracketing, and physical as well as virtual models, we reach an improved understanding of heteromorph ammonoid palaeobiology. Their anatomy, buoyancy, locomotion, predators, diet, palaeoecology, and extinction are discussed. Based on phylogenetic bracketing with nautiloids and coleoids, heteromorphs like other ammonoids had 10 arms, a well-developed brain, lens eyes, a buccal mass with a radula and a smaller upper as well as a larger lower jaw, and ammonia in their soft tissue. Heteromorphs likely lacked arm suckers, hooks, tentacles, a hood, and an ink sac. All Cretaceous heteromorphs share an aptychus-type lower jaw with a lamellar calcitic covering. Differences in radular tooth morphology and size in heteromorphs suggest a microphagous diet. Stomach contents of heteromorphs comprise planktic crustaceans, gastropods, and crinoids, suggesting a zooplanktic diet. Forms with a U-shaped body chamber (ancylocone) are regarded as suspension feeders, whereas orthoconic forms additionally might have consumed benthic prey. Heteromorphs could achieve near-neutral buoyancy regardless of conch shape or ontogeny. Orthoconic heteromorphs likely had a vertical orientation, whereas ancylocone heteromorphs had a near-horizontal aperture pointing upwards. Heteromorphs with a U-shaped body chamber are more stable hydrodynamically than modern Nautilus and were unable substantially to modify their orientation by active locomotion, i.e. they had no or limited access to benthic prey at adulthood. Pathologies reported for heteromorphs were likely inflicted by crustaceans, fish, marine reptiles, and other cephalopods. Pathologies on Ptychoceras corroborates an external shell and rejects the endocochleate hypothesis. Devonian, Triassic, and Jurassic heteromorphs had a preference for deep-subtidal to offshore facies but are rare in shallow-subtidal, slope, and bathyal facies. Early Cretaceous heteromorphs preferred deep-subtidal to bathyal facies. Late Cretaceous heteromorphs are common in shallow-subtidal to offshore facies. Oxygen isotope data suggest rapid growth and a demersal habitat for adult Discoscaphites and Baculites. A benthic embryonic stage, planktic hatchlings, and a habitat change after one whorl is proposed for Hoploscaphites. Carbon isotope data indicate that some Baculites lived throughout their lives at cold seeps. Adaptation to a planktic life habit potentially drove selection towards smaller hatchlings, implying high fecundity and an ecological role of the hatchlings as micro- and mesoplankton. The Chicxulub impact at the Cretaceous/Paleogene (K/Pg) boundary 66 million years ago is the likely trigger for the extinction of ammonoids. Ammonoids likely persisted after this event for 40?500 thousand years and are exclusively represented by heteromorphs. The ammonoid extinction is linked to their small hatchling sizes, planktotrophic diets, and higher metabolic rates than in nautilids, which survived the K/Pg mass extinction event.},

  abstract = {The ammonoid cephalopods range from the early Devonian to the late Cretaceous, a period of some 320 Ma. Because of their importance for biostratigraphic discrimination and their use in practical age dating for this period they have been intensively studied. Major extinctions at the close of the Devonian, end Permian, end Triassic and end Cretaceous have long been recognized and linked with regressional palaeogeographical events. The recognition of smaller-scale extinction events is relatively new and is especially well shown in the Palaeozoic, when there was a simpler distribution of land and sea pathways than in later periods when the influence of latitudinal distributions and local provinces was more severe. Extinction events in the Devonian show the nature of the process. Usually a gradual decline in diversity is followed by extinction; then there is a period of low diversity but often individual abundance. Then novelty appears and is seen in new characters of the early stages; elaboration and diversification follow. These fluctuations can often be correlated with changes in other groups and also with sedimentological and palaeogeographical changes. Usually a regression-transgression couplet is involved with evidence of ocean turnover indicated by anoxic or low-oxygen events. A new family, Sobolewiidae, is diagnosed. A new analysis of diversity, appearances and extinctions is made at the family level for 2 Ma time units throughout the history of the Ammonoidea. This record is compared with modern attempts to portray sea-level fluctuations and onlap and offlap movements of marine seas. The correlation, even in detail, is impressive and gives support for the species/area theory. But it is argued that temperature, as well as sea-level factors, is important. The evidence, on both large and small scales, shows an association of evolutionary change with palaeogeographical change. The new evidence does not suggest a role for periodicity above the Milankovitch Band level. Whether or not periodicity is involved, such factors seem more readily explained in endogenic earth causations and for the present these provide the most parsimonious explanations.}

Disentangling their relative importance is complicated by uncertainty regarding kill mechanisms and the relative timing of volcanogenic outgassing, impact, and extinction. We used carbon cycle modeling and paleotemperature records to constrain the timing of volcanogenic outgassing. We found support for major outgassing beginning and ending distinctly before the impact, with only the impact coinciding with mass extinction and biologically amplified carbon cycle change. Our models show that these extinction-related carbon cycle changes would have allowed the ocean to absorb massive amounts of carbon dioxide, thus limiting the global warming otherwise expected from postextinction volcanism.},

Echinoids of the Mons Basin show similarities to those of the Liège-Limburg Basin, but crinoids, asteroids and ophiuroids remain poorly known from the former. Echinoderms of the Danish Basin resemble those of similar chalk lithofacies in the Liège-Limburg Basin, despite significant geographical separation. These disparities can be explained, at least in part, by collector bias in sampling methodology, although differences in substrate presumably also had an influence.},

The wavy septa can form if the rear mantle of the ammonite, which functions as the template, has a complex shape. Previous hypotheses assumed that the rear mantle is like a flexible membrane that can be folded by some physical force. The elucidation of the mechanism of septa formation requires that the detailed shape of the septa should be known. We developed a new protocol of X-ray micro-computed tomography (CT) and obtained high-resolution three-dimensional (3D) images of the septa of the Upper Cretaceous ammonite Damesites cf. damesi. The obtained image suggested that the wavy and branched structures of the rear mantle grew autonomously. We found that some extant sea slugs have branched structures and showed similar shape and growth sequence as those in fossils, suggesting that the mantle of molluscs basically has the potential to form branched projections. Based on the characteristics of the obtained 3D structure, we explain how ammonites might have formed the complex suture patterns.},

Here, we test these alternatives in fossil and living molluscan taxa. Late Cretaceous gastropod genera exhibit a strong negative relation between the geographical ranges of constituent species and speciation rate per species per million years; this result is robust to sampling biases against small–bodied taxa and is not attributable to phylogenetic effects. They also exhibit weak inverse or non–significant relations between geographical range and (i) the total number of species produced over the 18 million year timeframe, and (ii) the number of species in a single timeplane. Sister–group comparisons using extant molluscan species also show a non–significant relation between median geographical range and species richness of genera. These results support the view that the factors promoting broad geographical ranges also tend to damp speciation rates. They also demonstrate that a strong inverse relation between per–species speciation rate and geographical range need not be reflected in analyses conducted within a single timeplane, underscoring the inadequacy of treating net speciation as a proxy for raw per–taxon rates.},

Our reanalysis of Jablonski's work on heritability at the species level finds that geographic range is significantly heritable (using a randomization test) in both bivalves and gastropods, even within a single larval mode. Further, generalized linear models show that geographic range size is more important than larval mode in predicting extinction probability in both gastropods and bivalves. These results reaffirm the role and heritability of geographic range as a species‐level property that can promote species selection; the model‐based approach applied here may help to operationalize “screening off ” and related approaches to evaluating hierarchical explanations in evolution.},

Correlations with other areas (e.g., Europe, United States Western Interior, Pacific coast of North and South America) therefore have to rely solely on event stratigraphy; not only extinctions, but all biotic events must be considered. During the Cretaceous, Pacific faunas were characterised not so much by the presence of typical ‘Boreal’ assemblages, but rather by the absence or extreme paucity of other widely distributed biota. Clearly, faunal similarities depended more on regional facies development than on their spatial distribution. The regional diversity curve reflects all global mass extinctions, faunal turnovers and radiations. A detailed analysis of ammonite evolution, based on mid- and Late Cretaceous sections from the Russian Pacific coast, plus a comparison with other provinces across the globe, fails to support a trend in decreasing ammonite diversity since the late Albian. On the contrary, ammonites demonstrated a high adaptive ability after each extinction event and recovered from each with new radiations.},

Verkiezelingen zijn schaars te noemen, en dan gaat het vaak ook nog om de kleinere soorten (Baculitidae, Scaphitidae). Hoewel er regelmatig soorten bij komen die nog niet uit het gebied bekend waren, echte unica vaak, wordt hieronder geprobeerd een volledig overzicht te geven van alle Nederlandse vormen, ook van die welke (nog) niet tot op soort zijn gedetermineerd. Op weinige uitzonderingen na zijn alle hier genoemde soorten ook bekend uit het buitenland, sommige zelfs van de Atlantische kust van Noord-Amerika en zodoende zeer geschikt als gidsfossielen. Net als in New Jersey183-185 en Stevns Klint, Denemarken197199 zijn er soorten die de Krijt-Paleogeen (K/Pg) grens overleefd lijken te hebben; dat geldt voor Scaphitidae en Baculitidae.},

(P.) noetlingi Kennedy, in Fatmi and Kennedy, 1999 and Menuites fresvillensis (Seunes, 1890), as well as two scaphitid taxa (Hoploscaphites pungens pungens (Binkhorst van den Binkhorst, 1862) and H.~felderi Kennedy, 1987) and a single diplomoceratid, Diplomoceras cylindraceum (Defrance, 1816), suggest that also equivalents of the Nekum Member (Maastricht Formation) are represented in the Kunrade–Benzenrade area.},

For a macrofossil zonation of the uppermost Maastrichtian, coleoid and ammonoid cephalopods and inoceramid bivalves are of prime importance, while biozonations for the lowermost Palaeocene rely particularly on echinoid and asteroid species. On coleoid and ammonoid evidence, the type Maastrichtian is coeval with the uppermost Maastrichtian as interpreted in the Tethyan realm (Bay of Biscay sections in particular) and the North Temperate realm (NW and NE Europe). The occurrence in the lower part of the Geulhem Member (Houthem Formation) of distinctive, exclusively Early Danian echinoderm species suggests that the entire Lower Danian of the Danian type area is represented in the Maastricht area, and that what is considered to be the uppermost part of the underlying Meerssen Member (Maastricht Formation) represents the equivalent of the Early Danian 'Cerithium Kalk' in Denmark.},

  abstract = {The world contains boundaries (e.g., continental edge for terrestrial taxa) that impose geometric constraints on the distribution of species ranges. Thus, contrary to traditional thinking, the expected species richness pattern in absence of ecological or physiographical factors is unlikely to be uniform. Species richness has been shown to peak in the middle of a bounded one-dimensional domain, even in the absence of ecological or physiographical factors. Because species ranges are not linear, an extension of the approach to two dimensions is necessary. Here we present a two-dimensional null model accounting for effects of geometric constraints. We use the model to examine the effects of continental edge on the distribution of terrestrial animals in Africa and compare the predictions with the observed pattern of species richness in birds endemic to the continent. Latitudinal, longitudinal, and two-dimensional patterns of species richness are predicted well from the modeled null effects alone. As expected, null effects are of high significance for wide ranging species only. Our results highlight the conceptual significance of an until recently neglected constraint from continental shape alone and support a more cautious analysis of species richness patterns at this scale.},

  abstract = {The open-source programming language ‘R' has become a standard tool in the palaeobiologist's toolkit. Its popularity within the palaeobiological community continues to grow, with published articles increasingly citing the usage of R and R packages. However, there are currently a lack of agreed standards for data preparation and available frameworks to support the implementation of such standards. Consequently, data preparation workflows are often unclear and not reproducible, even when code is provided. Moreover, due to a lack of code accessibility and documentation, palaeobiologists are often forced to ‘reinvent the wheel’ to find solutions to issues already solved by other members of the community. Here, we introduce palaeoverse, a community-driven R package to aid data preparation and exploration for quantitative palaeobiological research. The package is freely available and has three core principles: (1) streamline data preparation and analyses; (2) enhance code readability; and (3) improve reproducibility of results. To develop these aims, we assessed the analytical needs of the broader palaeobiological community using an online survey, in addition to incorporating our own experiences. In this work, we first report the findings of the survey, which shaped the development of the package. Subsequently, we describe and demonstrate the functionality available in palaeoverse and provide usage examples. Finally, we discuss the resources we have made available for the community and our future plans for the broader Palaeoverse project. palaeoverse is a community-driven R package for palaeobiology, developed with the intention of bringing palaeobiologists together to establish agreed standards for high-quality quantitative research. The package provides a user-friendly platform for preparing data for analysis with well-documented open-source code to enhance transparency. The functionality available in palaeoverse improves code reproducibility and accessibility, which is beneficial for both the review process and future research.},

The early life stages of invertebrates with internal and external aragonite structures may be particularly vulnerable to this ocean acidification. Impacts to cephalopods, which form aragonite cuttlebones and statoliths, are of concern because of the central role they play in many ocean ecosystems and because of their importance to global fisheries. Atlantic longfin squid (Doryteuthis pealeii), an ecologically and economically valuable taxon, were reared from eggs to hatchlings (paralarvae) under ambient and elevated CO2 concentrations in replicated experimental trials. Animals raised under elevated pCO2 demonstrated significant developmental changes including increased time to hatching and shorter mantle lengths, although differences were small. Aragonite statoliths, critical for balance and detecting movement, had significantly reduced surface area and were abnormally shaped with increased porosity and altered crystal structure in elevated pCO2-reared paralarvae. These developmental and physiological effects could alter squid paralarvae behavior and survival in the wild, directly and indirectly impacting marine food webs and commercial fisheries.},

  abstract = {High-level classification of the nautiloid cephalopods has been largely neglected since the publication of the Russian and American treatises in the early 1960s. Although there is broad general agreement amongst specialists regarding the status of nautiloid orders, there is no real consensus or consistent approach regarding higher ranks and an array of superorders utilising various morphological features has been proposed. With work now commencing on the revision of the Treatise Part K, there is an urgent need for a methodical and standardised approach to the high-level classification of the nautiloids. The scheme proposed here utilizes the form of muscle attachment scars as a diagnostic feature at subclass level; other features (including siphuncular structures and cameral deposits) are employed at ordinal level. We recognise five subclasses of nautiloid cephalopods (Plectronoceratia, Multiceratia, Tarphyceratia nov., Orthoceratia, Nautilia) and 18 orders including the Order Rioceratida nov. which contains the new family Bactroceratidae. This scheme has the advantage of relative simplicity (it avoids the use of superorders) and presents a balanced approach which reflects the considerable morphological diversity and phylogenetic longevity of the nautiloids in comparison with the ammonoid and coleoid cephalopods. To avoid potential confusion arising in the higher levels of nautiloid classification employed in the revision of the Treatise Part K, we propose herein to replace the suffix ‘-oidea’ at subclass level with the suffix ‘-ia’. Apart from removing ambiguity and clarifying the nomenclature, this approach also brings greater consistency and affinity with modern zoological classification schemes used for cephalopods. The original Treatise Part K adopted an ‘abbreviated’ form of name for nautiloid orders using the ending ‘-cerida’ rather than ‘-ceratida’ (e.g., Order Actinocerida rather than Actinoceratida). For the revision of Treatise Part K, we propose using the ‘full’ version of the ordinal names. This approach re-employs several order names in their original form, e.g., Ellesmeroceratida, Oncoceratida, and Tarphyceratida. For reasons of consistency, we also apply the same to ordinal names created since the original Treatise Part K; therefore, Order Bisonocerida becomes Bisonoceratida.},

Differentiating between straight conical conchs (orthocones) of Palaeozoic Coleoidea and other ectocochleates is only possible when rostrum (shell covering the chambered phragmocone) and body chamber are preserved. Here, we provide information on how this internalization might have evolved. We re-examined one of the oldest coleoids, Gordoniconus beargulchensis from the Early Carboniferous of the Bear Gulch Fossil-Lagerstätte (Montana) by synchrotron, various lights and Reflectance Transformation Imaging (RTI). This revealed previously unappreciated anatomical details, on which we base evolutionary scenarios of how the internalization and other evolutionary steps in early coleoid evolution proceeded. We suggest that conch internalization happened rather suddenly including early growth stages while the ink sac evolved slightly later.},

We separately examined Cephalopoda with orthoconic conchs (without ammonoids and coleoids), Nautilida, Ammonoida (without heteromorphs), and Neocoleoida (squids, octopuses and their ancestors). The long-term trajectories of these groups differ in their overall trends. Each of these groups reacted in other ways to the mass extinctions. All groups except the nautilids evolved species exceeding one meter in size, which belong to the marine megafauna. Nautilids and orthocones share a threshold volume of about 100~litres, while in ammonoids and neocoleoids, the limit lies closer to 500~litres.},

The proportion of bivalves increased from 40 to 56\% of the fauna, and the proportion of ammonites decreased from 28 to 18\%. Thirteen published reports listed 65 species from 203 reported occurrences. Data from all sources showed 170 species for 1050 occurrences. By using abundance data and assuming a log-normal distribution, as many as 200 fossilizable mollusc species may have inhabited the Western Interior during the uppermost biozone of the Cenomanian.

  abstract = {Cephalopods are extraordinary molluscs equipped with vertebrate-like intelligence and a unique buoyancy system for locomotion. A growing body of evidence from the fossil record, embryology and Bayesian molecular divergence estimations provides a comprehensive picture of their origins and evolution. Cephalopods evolved during the Cambrian (∼530 Ma) from a monoplacophoran-like mollusc in which the conical, external shell was modified into a chambered buoyancy apparatus. During the mid-Palaeozoic (∼416 Ma) cephalopods diverged into nautiloids and the presently dominant coleoids. Coleoids (i.e. squids, cuttlefish and octopods) internalised their shells and, in the late Palaeozoic (∼276 Ma), diverged into Vampyropoda and the Decabrachia. This shell internalisation appears to be a unique evolutionary event. In contrast, the loss of a mineralised shell has occurred several times in distinct coleoid lineages. The general tendency of shell reduction reflects a trend towards active modes of life and much more complex behaviour.},

We present three-dimensional reconstructions of the buccal apparatus in the Mesozoic ammonite Baculites with the use of synchrotron x-ray microtomography. Buccal mass morphology, combined with the coexistence of food remains found in the buccal mass, suggests that these ammonites fed on plankton. This diet may have extended to all aptychophoran ammonites, which share the same buccal mass morphology. Understanding the role of these ammonites in the Mesozoic food web provides insights into their radiation in the Early Jurassic, as well as their extinction at the end of the Cretaceous/early Paleogene.},

  abstract = {One of the puzzles about the end-Cretaceous extinctions is why some organisms disappeared and others survived. A notable example is the differential extinction of ammonites and survival of nautilids, the two groups of co-occurring, externally shelled cephalopods at the end of the Cretaceous. To investigate the role of geographic distribution in explaining this outcome, we compiled a database of all the occurrences of ammonites and the nautilid genus Eutrephoceras in the last 0.5 m.y. of the Maastrichtian. We also included recently published data on ammonite genera that appear to have briefly survived into the Paleocene. Using two metrics to evaluate the geographic range of each genus (first, a convex hull encompassing all of the occurrences of each genus, and second, the maximum distance between occurrences for each genus), we documented that most ammonite genera at the end of the Maastrichtian were restricted in their geographic distribution, possibly making them more vulnerable to extinction. The geographic distribution of those genera that may have briefly survived into the Paleocene is significantly greater than that of non-surviving genera, implying that more broadly distributed genera were more resistant to extinction. This pattern is further emphasized by the broad distribution of Eutrephoceras, which matches that of the most widely distributed ammonites at the end of the Maastrichtian. However, even the most widely distributed ammonites eventually succumbed to extinction, whereas Eutrephoceras survived. Evidently, a broad geographic distribution may have initially protected some ammonites against extinction, but it did not guarantee their survival.},

The ammonites at this time represent all four Mesozoic suborders comprising six superfamilies, 31 (sub)genera, and 57 species. The distribution of ammonites is dependent on the environmental setting. Recent data suggest that ammonites persisted to the boundary and some species may have survived for several tens of thousands of years into the Paleogene. The best explanation for ammonite extinction is a brief episode of ocean acidification immediately following the Chixculub impact, which caused the decimation of the calcareous plankton including the planktic post-hatching stages of ammonites. The geographic distribution of ammonites may also have played a role in the events with more broadly distributed genera being more resistant to extinction.},

  abstract = {‘Heteromorph ammonoids’ encompass all ammonoid species whose shapes do not conform to a closely coiled planispiral shell. The term is useful as a broad description for such ammonoids. However, as a concept, ‘heteromorph ammonoids’ no longer has any scientific value or explanatory power. Although such ammonoids have traditionally been considered aberrant forms, they represent instead an integral part of the evolutionary history of the Ammonoidea. ‘Heteromorph ammonoids’, as a whole, are a polyphyletic group, consisting of a heterogeneous mixture of taxa without any phylogenetic, morphological or ecological coherence. Their treatment as a single entity risks conflating convergences and phylogenetic affinities. It also vastly oversimplifies the stunning array of morphologies and ecological niches occupied by these animals. Investigation into the uncoiling (and recoiling) of ammonoids is a legitimate and worthwhile enterprise, especially in view of the realization that this phenomenon occurred several times in the history of the Ammonoidea. However, few insights can be gained by treating ‘heteromorph ammonoids’ as a single entity. Studies of such ammonoids should focus on monophyletic groups within a well‐constrained phylogenetic and stratigraphical framework to yield meaningful results.

  abstract = {The nautilid Eutrephoceras dekayi (Morton 1834) is relatively abundant in the lower Maastrichtian (Upper Cretaceous) Pierre Shale of east‐central Montana. We analysed the morphology, size frequency distribution, and isotope composition of a large collection of 220 well‐preserved specimens including hatchlings, juveniles and adults. The newly hatched shell is approximately 14~mm in diameter with a body chamber one‐third whorl in angular length terminating in the nepionic constriction. Internally, the embryonic shell contains five septa. Juveniles are abundant and comprise two‐thirds of the sample whereas sub‐adults, defined by the incipient flattening of the venter, are rare. Adults comprise approximately one‐third of the sample and average 100~mm in diameter. The co‐occurrence of newly hatched shells, small juveniles and adults suggests that the eggs were laid in the same area in which the hatchlings developed. Based on the excellent preservation of the juveniles, we conclude that they did not float into the area after death, but lived in the region, implying that this area served as a nursery for young animals. The calculated temperatures of the embryonic shells are similar to those of the post‐embryonic shells and generally range from 16 to 18~°C. Upon hatching, the nautilids probably followed a demersal mode of life and lived in well‐oxygenated water ≤50~m deep. An examination of lethal injuries (puncture holes) suggests that all ontogenetic stages were equally vulnerable to predation. The proximity of the site to the Sheridan Delta suggests that the specimens were smothered by sudden pulses of sediment transported into the area by major storms.

  abstract = {Scaphitid ammonites (scaphites) are common in the Upper Cretaceous Pierre Shale and Bearpaw Shale of the Western Interior of North America. We redescribe Hoploscaphites nodosus (Owen, 1852) and H. brevis (Meek, 1876) from the Baculites compressus–B. cuneatus zones of the upper Campanian. The types of both of these species were collected in the mid-19th century in what was then called Nebraska Territory, and included parts of present-day South Dakota, North Dakota, and Montana. Based on our present knowledge of the distribution of these species, the type material was probably collected from the B. compressus–B. cuneatus zones in the Pierre Shale at Sage Creek, a tributary of the Cheyenne River, Pennington County, South Dakota.Traditionally, the more robust, more coarsely ornamented scaphites (comprising the “nodosus group”) from the Pierre Shale and Bearpaw Shale were assigned to Jeletzkytes Riccardi, 1983, and the more slender, more finely ornamented scaphites were assigned to Hoploscaphites Nowak, 1911. However, our large collections of these scaphites from the Baculites compressus–B. cuneatus zones reveal a complete intergradation between the two morphological extremes, and for many specimens, the choice of genus is arbitrary. In addition, our studies of other biostratigraphic zones in the Pierre Shale and Bearpaw Shale reveal that cooccurring species of these two “genera” share more in common with each other than they do with congeneric species from other horizons. Furthermore, contrary to earlier assumptions, Jeletkytes is not endemic to the Western Interior Basin of North America and occurs, for example, in the U.S. Atlantic Coastal Plain and Europe. We thus provisionally treat Jeletzkytes as a junior subjective synonym of Hoploscaphites. This expanded definition of Hoploscaphites is consistent with present-day concepts of other scaphitid genera such as Discoscaphites Meek, 1876, and Trachyscaphites Cobban and Scott, 1964.In Hoploscaphites nodosus and H. brevis, the juvenile shell is planispirally coiled with a small umbilicus. The whorl section is initially depressed and becomes more compressed through ontogeny. The angle of the body chamber in juveniles is approximately two-thirds of a whorl. At the approach of maturity, the shell uncoils, forming a relatively long shaft and recurved hook. The ratio of whorl width to whorl height reaches a minimum value at midshaft. The apertural margin at maturity is constricted and terminates in a flared lip. Commonly, the last two or three septa, corresponding to the formation of the hook, are more closely spaced (approximated). These features indicate that the rate of growth decreased and eventually stopped at maturity (“morphogenetic countdown” associated with determinate growth). Both species of scaphites occur as dimorphs, which are referred to as macroconchs (presumably females) and microconchs (presumably males). In samples of specimens of the same species within a single concretion, macroconchs are approximately 20\% larger than microconchs. In addition to size, dimorphs are distinguished by differences in shape, including the presence or absence of an umbilical bulge, the size of the umbilical diameter, the outline of the umbilical shoulder relative to that of the venter in side view, and the relative change in whorl height in passing from the mature phragmocone to the shaft of the body chamber.The holotype of Hoploscaphites nodosus, by monotypy, is UC 6381, the original of Scaphites nodosus Owen (1852: 581, pl. 8, fig. 4). Adults exhibit a range of variation in size, degree of compression, and coarseness of ornament. The exposed phragmocone occupies most of the coiled portion of the shell, and is approximately two-thirds of a whorl in angular length. Adults are large (LMAX averages 91.8 mm in macroconchs and 78.0 mm in microconchs) and ellipsoidal in side view, with a strongly recurved hook (apertural angle averages 73° in macroconchs).

  abstract = {A section containing the Cretaceous/Paleogene (= Cretaceous/Tertiary) boundary in Monmouth County, New Jersey, preserves a record of ammonites extending from the end of the Cretaceous into possibly the beginning of the Danian. The section includes the upper part of the Tinton Formation and lower part of the Hornerstown Formation. The top of the Tinton Formation is represented by a richly fossiliferous unit (the Pinna Layer) that contains many bivalves in life position as well as ammonite jaws preserved inside body chambers. Ammonites include Pachydiscus (Neodesmoceras) mokotibensis, Sphenodiscus lobatus, Eubaculites carinatus, E. latecarinatus; Discoscaphites iris, D. sphaeroidalis; D. minardi, and D. jerseyensis. The Pinna Layer probably represents a relatively short interval of time lasting tens to hundreds of years; it is conformably overlain by the Burrowed Unit, which contains a single fragment of Discoscaphites sp. and several fragments of E. latecarinatus, as well as several isolated specimens of ammonite jaws including two of Eubaculites. Examination of the mode of preservation of the ammonites and jaws suggests that they were fossilized during deposition of the Burrowed Unit and were not reworked from older deposits. Based on the ammonites and dinoflagellates in the Pinna Layer and the Burrowed Unit, these strata traditionally would be assigned to the uppermost Maastrichtian, corresponding to calcareous nannofossil Subzone CC26b. However, a weak iridium anomaly (500–600 pg/g) is present at the base of the Pinna Layer, which presumably represents the record of the bolide impact. Correlation with the iridium layer at the Global Stratotype Section and Point at El Kef, Tunisia, would, therefore, imply that these assemblages are actually Danian, provided that the iridium anomaly is in place and the ammonites and dinoflagellates are not reworked. If the iridium anomaly is in place, or even if it has migrated downward from the top of the Pinna Layer, the ammonites would have survived the impact at this site for a brief interval of time lasting from a few days to hundreds of years.},

  abstract = {Paleobiological diversity is often expressed as α (within-sample), β (among-sample), and γ (total) diversities. However, when studying the effects of extinction on diversity patterns, only variations in α and γ diversities are typically addressed. A null model that examines changes in β diversity as a function of percent extinction is presented here.The model examines diversity in the context of a hierarchical sampling strategy that allows for the additive partitioning of γ diversity into mean α and β diversities at varying scales. Here, the sampling hierarchy has four levels: samples, beds, facies, and region; thus, there are four levels of α diversity (α1, α2, α3, α4) and three levels of β diversity (β1, β2, and β3). Taxa are randomly assigned to samples within the hierarchy according to probability of occurrence, and initial mean α and β values are calculated. A regional extinction is imposed, and the hierarchy is resampled from the remaining extant taxa. Post-extinction mean α and β values are then calculated.Both non-selective and selective extinctions with respect to taxon abundance yield decreases in α, β, and γ diversities. Non-selective extinction with respect to taxon abundance shows little effect on diversity partitioning except at the highest extinction magnitudes (above 75\% extinction), where the contribution of α1 to total γ increases at the expense of β3, with β1 and β2 varying little with increasing extinction magnitude. The pre-extinction contribution of α1 to total diversity increases with increased probabilities of taxon occurrence and the number of shared taxa between facies. Both β1 and β2 contribute equally to total diversity at low occurrence probabilities, but β2 is negligible at high probabilities, because individual samples preserve all the taxonomic variation present within a facies. Selective extinction with respect to rare taxa indicates a constant increase in α1 and constant decrease in β3 with increasing extinction magnitudes, whereas selective extinction with respect to abundant taxa yields the opposite pattern of an initial decrease in α1 and increase in β3. Both β1 and β2 remain constant with increasing extinction for both cases of selectivity. By comparing diversity partitioning before and after an extinction event, it may be possible to determine whether the extinction was selective with respect to taxon abundances, and if so, whether that selectivity was against rare or abundant taxa.Field data were collected across a Late Ordovician regional extinction in the Nashville Dome of Tennessee, with sampling hierarchy similar to that of the model. These data agree with the abundant-selective model, showing declines in α, β, and γ diversities, and a decrease in α1 and increase in β3, which suggests this extinction may have targeted abundant taxa.}

Anglonautilus praeundulatus n. sp. is described from the lower Aptian of eastern Spain. It is the first record of this genus from Spain and constitutes the oldest definite representative of the genus. This places the new species at the base of the evolutionary history of Anglonautilus. Its ornamental features confirm the previously assumed close relationship between Anglonautilus and Cymatoceras. An analysis of the ornamental pattern of all species hitherto referred to Anglonautilus indicates that there is an evolutionary lineage leading to the type species of the genus, A.~undulatus, and a single successor (A.~subalbensis). Several Late Cretaceous species hitherto identified as Anglonautilus (A.~japonicus, A.~mamiyai, A.~suciensis) bear fold-like ribs superficially similar to typical representatives of Anglonautilus. The pattern of ornament in these taxa is very different at closer inspection, though. This suggests that these species developed independently from Cymatoceras. The undulations present in these taxa are interpreted here as a result of convergent evolution. They are therefore excluded from the genus Anglonautilus and provisionally referred to as “Anglonautilus” spp.},

The evolution of fractal-like, internal walls of ammonoid cephalopod shells represent one of the most clear evolutionary trends toward complexity in biology, but the driver behind their iterative evolution has remained unanswered since the first hypotheses introduced in the early 1800s. We show a clear correlation between the fractal-like morphology and structural stability. Using linear and nonlinear computational mechanical simulations, we demonstrate that the increase in the complexity of septal geometry leads to a substantial increase in the mechanical stability of the entire shell. We hypothesize that the observed tendency is a driving force toward the evolution of the higher complexity of ammonoid septa, providing the animals with superior structural support and protection against predation. Resolving the adaptational value of this unique trait is vital to fully comprehend the intricate evolutionary trends between morphology, ecological shifts, and mass extinctions through Earth’s history.},

  abstract = {The latitudinal diversity gradient (LDG) designates the increase in species richness toward the tropics. While geological and climatic changes are recognized as key drivers, the precise factors and their relative contributions to species richness gradients remain debated. Using a spatially explicit eco-evolutionary model, we simulate diversification over 125 million years. We validate the model with empirical mammalian richness patterns, and uncover a pivotal role of paleoclimate and paleogeography. This approach allows us to investigate both the mechanisms driving the LDG and space and time variations in species diversification rates across dynamic landscapes integrating changes in tectonic, climatic and surface processes. We show how scale-dependent surface processes are a key driver of regional diversity patterns and how LDG can emerge under a wide range of eco-evolutionary scenarios. Plate tectonics and the subsequent enduring uneven distribution of land masses within the North and South hemispheres imprinted an asymmetric pattern of species diversification rates, primarily shaped by paleoclimate and paleogeography and only to a lesser extent by surface processes. Our simulations also indicate that the LDG has persisted since the Cretaceous, steepened and stabilized from the early Cenozoic on. The modeled scenarios depict that species primarily originate in the tropics and disperse toward the poles without losing their tropical presence. The tropics not only served as a cradle, fostering the origination of new species, but also as a museum, preserving biodiversity over deep time.},

The excellent exposure of this sequence has offered an opportunity for detailed stratigraphic study of the fauna, providing a stratigraphic control unavailable for most other Southern Hemisphere strata of similar age. Ammonites are restricted to the Cretaceous portion of the Lopez de Bertodano Formation, becoming more abundant and increasing in diversity within a 600-m interval below the Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary. The ammonite-rich levels are divided into three zones (from oldest to youngest: Pachydiscus ootacodensis, P. riccardi and P. ultimus zones), extending from the late Campanian-Maastrichtian to the latest Maastrichtian. The taxonomic study of this fauna shows a predominance of endemic taxa of the family Kossmaticeratidae, including the species Maorites tuberculatus Howarth, M. seymourianus (Kilian and Reboul), M. densicostatus (Kilian and Reboul), M. weddelliensis n. sp., Grossouvrites gemmatus (Huppe) and Gunnarites bhavaniformis (Kilian and Reboul). These taxa, together with the members of the family Desmoceratidae Kitchinites (Kitchinites) darwini (Steinmann) and K. (K.) laurae n. sp., are mostly restricted to the margins of the Late Cretaceous Weddellian Province that extended from southern South America to Australia. Cosmopolitan genera described in this work become more abundant up section and include the species Anagaudryceras seymouriense n. sp., Zelandites varuna (Forbes), Pseudophyllites loryi (Kilian and Reboul), Diplomoceras lambi Spath, Pachydiscus (Pachydiscus) ootacodensis (Stoliczka), P.

  abstract = {The Late Cretaceous ammonite family Kossmaticeratidae had a distribution mostly restricted to the margins of Gondwana. The progressively endemic character of this family can be explained in terms of plate movements and the fragmentation of Gondwana. Members of the Kossmaticeratidae appeared in the Turonian of India, populated the paleoshores of India, Madagascar, and South Africa during the Coniacian, and migrated to New Zealand in the Santonian. A rapid diversification of this family took place during the early Campanian in Madagascar and South Africa. As India migrated north and South Africa separated from South America during Campanian time, kossmaticeratid faunas, which were probably adapted to cooler waters, gradually disappeared at these localities. The separation of India and Africa from Gondwana effectively isolated the southern Pacific margin from other shallow water seas of the world. After this event, the family Kossmaticeratidae became progressively endemic. A major period of diversification occurred during the late Campanian-Maastrichtian in the Weddellian Province which embraced the shallow seas off Patagonia, the Antarctic Peninsula, New Zealand, and New Caledonia. This increased endemism and dominance of the Kossmaticeratidae is clearly displayed in the ammonite faunas from Patagonia and the Antarctic Peninsula where the proportion of its components in relation to the total ammonite fauna increased linearly from the early Campanian to the Maastrichtian.},

Most of the specimens represent internal and external moulds of shell fragments, the sole exception being a complete, well preserved internal mould of H. constrictus. The infilling of the body chamber and o phragmocone of this specimen is indistinguishable from the surrounding limestone. The 13C value for the phragmo­cone fill is 1.382, matching Danian values much better than the more positive o Maastrichtian values for the fine-fraction 13C curve of the Stevns Klint succession. Additionally, the phragmocone infill contains Operculodinella operculata, a calcareous dinocyst typical of the Danian at high latitudes. The specimen is thus interpreted to be an indigenous early Danian ammonite. In view of the mass occur­rence of calcitic bryozoans, brachiopods, and bivalves in the topmost Maastrichtian chalk at Stevns Klint, the total absence of brachiopods and near-absence of bryozoans and calcitic bivalves in the Cerithium Limestone provide evidence against significant redeposition of Maastrichtian fossils into the latter unit. Consequently, all ammonites from the Cerithium Limestone studied are interpreted as early Danian survivors.},

Transformation of a discontinuity surface into a heavily burrowed ‘pseudobreccia’ may further complicate the record, but this issue has remained unexploited to date. The richly fossiliferous Cretaceous–Paleogene (Maastrichtian–Danian) boundary interval exposed in Poland provides opportunities to test the influence of burrow-generated pseudobreccia on the preservation of associated hiatal fossil concentrations. Here, we document pseudobreccia anatomy and fossil-sediment relationships by three-dimensional X-ray computed tomography imaging. In the pseudobreccia zone, we identify a distinctive assemblage of late Maastrichtian fossils, which underwent subsurface preparation by burrowers in a hitherto unreported ichno-taphonomic process. Recognition of pseudobreccia is a prerequisite for the interpretation of the stratigraphy, sedimentology and fossil record of such intervals, which is of special interest for periods of major biotic turnovers, like the end-Cretaceous mass extinction.},

Here, cephalopods (ammonites and nautilids), organic-walled dinoflagellates (dinocysts) and foraminifera from the uppermost Maastrichtian interval are studied. In terms of ammonite biostratigraphy, the upper Maastrichtian Hoploscaphites constrictus crassus Zone is documented up to a level 120~cm below the K-Pg boundary. There is no direct, ammonite-based evidence of the highest Maastrichtian H. constrictus johnjagti Zone. However, the predominance of the dinocyst marker taxon Palynodinium grallator suggests the presence of the equivalent of the uppermost Maastrichtian Thalassiphora pelagica Subzone, which is correlatable with the H.~c. johnjagti ammonite Zone. The planktonic foraminiferal assemblage is coeval with that from the H.~c. johnjagti Zone as well. These data indicate that the top of the Maastrichtian at Lechówka is complete within the limits of biostratigraphic resolution, albeit slightly condensed. The dinocyst and foraminiferal assemblages are dominated by taxa that are characteristic of high-energy, marginal marine environments. A reduction in test size among the calcareous epifaunal benthic foraminifera is observed at a level 50~cm below the K-Pg boundary, which is possibly related to environmental stress associated with Deccan volcanism.},

The taxonomy and stratigraphical distribution of these, and allied forms, are studied, on the basis~of material from the opoka succession across the upper Campanian–lowermost Maastrichtian boundary in the~Middle Vistula River section, central Poland. in view of the imprecise location of two ammonite GSSP markers~in that section, a direct ammonite-based correlation with the GSSP at Tercis is impossible. however, data available~indicate that in the Middle Vistula River section the first occurrence of Pachydiscus (P.) neubergicus and~the last occurrence of Nostoceras (N.) hyatti are situated significantly higher than the first occurrence of Belemnella~lanceolata, the traditional belemnite marker for the base of the Maastrichtian Stage in the Boreal Realm,~and that Diplomoceras cylindraceum appears significantly below this level.

One of these is probably from the lower/upper Maastrichtian boundary interval at Frejlev, while the other two originate from the uppermost Maastrichtian chalk as exposed in the Dania quarry; both localities are in Jylland, northern Denmark. These are first reports of E. vaelsense from Denmark; the species has previously been recorded from the uppermost Campanian and lower Maastrichtian of the Netherlands, Belgium, northern Germany and Poland. The presence of E. vaelsense in the topmost Maastrichtian white chalk in the Dania quarry is considered the youngest record of Epicymatoceras known to date, suggesting the persistence of the genus until the end of the Cretaceous. The diameter of the embryonic conch of the Danish E. vaelsense may be estimated at c. 30 mm, based on an individual from the Dania quarry, confirming earlier observations that the species possessed one of the largest embryonic conchs amongst Late Cretaceous nautilids.},

  abstract = {The fossil record of Nautilida in carbonate facies is skewed towards moulds (steinkerns) in various states of preservation, which complicates assessment of the original shell ornament of many taxa. As a remarkable exception, moulds of Epicymatoceras vaelsense from upper Campanian and lower Maastrichtian (Upper Cretaceous) siliceous limestones (opoka) in Poland retain details of the original shell ornament, allowing conclusions on the original structure of the shell wall, systematic position and hatching size of this nautilid to be drawn. Both external and internal moulds are present in the material studied, which are referred to as taphomorph 1 and 2, respectively. Based on morphology and inferred taphonomy, it is proposed that the external ribbing of E. vaelsense was originally composed of overlapping, tile-shaped lamellae of the outer prismatic layer, a character recently suggested to be a synapomorphy for the cymatoceratid clade. The diameter of the embryonic conch of E. vaelsense is estimated to have been around 30~mm, which is near the maximum range of hatching size recorded for Cretaceous and younger nautilids. On the basis of the inferred shell structure of E.~vaelsense, it is speculated that living individuals of this nautilid were covered by a dense periostracal cover similar to that of Recent Allonautilus scrobiculatus. This study demonstrates that nautilid moulds may provide a better source of palaeontological data than conventionally accepted.},

Prior to computers, these synoptic datasets were compiled by hand, a laborious undertaking that took years of effort and forced palaeontologists to make difficult choices about what types of data to tabulate. The advent of desktop computers ushered in palaeontology's first digital revolution—online literature-based databases, such as the Paleobiology Database (PBDB). However, the published literature represents only a small proportion of the palaeontological data housed in museum collections. Although this issue has long been appreciated, the magnitude, and thus potential significance, of these so-called ‘dark data’ has been difficult to determine. Here, in the early phases of a second digital revolution in palaeontology­—the digitization of museum collections—we provide an estimate of the magnitude of palaeontology's dark data. Digitization of our nine institutions' holdings of Cenozoic marine invertebrate collections from California, Oregon and Washington in the USA reveals that they represent 23 times the number of unique localities than are currently available in the PBDB. These data, and the vast quantity of similarly untapped dark data in other museum collections, will, when digitally mobilized, enhance palaeontologists’ ability to make inferences about the patterns and processes of past evolutionary and ecological changes.},

  abstract = {Many aspects of deep-time Earth System models, including mantle convection, paleoclimatology, paleobiogeography and the deep Earth carbon cycle, require high-resolution plate motion models that include the evolution of the mosaic of plate boundaries through time. We present the first continuous late Paleozoic to present-day global plate model with evolving plate boundaries, building on and extending two previously published models for the late Paleozoic (410–250Ma) and Mesozoic-Cenozoic (230–0Ma). We ensure continuity during the 250–230Ma transition period between the two models, update the absolute reference frame of the Mesozoic-Cenozoic model and add a new Paleozoic reconstruction for the Baltica-derived Alexander Terrane, now accreted to western North America. This 410–0Ma open access model provides a framework for deep-time whole Earth modelling and acts as a base for future extensions and refinement. We analyse the model in terms of the number of plates, predicted plate size distribution, plate and continental root mean square (RMS) speeds, plate velocities and trench migration through time. Overall model trends share many similarities to those for recent times, which we use as a first order benchmark against which to compare the model and identify targets for future model refinement. Except for during the period \textasciitilde 260–160Ma, the number of plates (16–46) and ratio of “large” plates (≥107.5km2) to smaller plates (\textasciitilde 2.7–6.6) are fairly similar to present-day values (46 and 6.6, respectively), with lower values occurring during late Paleozoic assembly and growth of Pangea. This temporal pattern may also reflect difficulties in reconstructing small, now subducted oceanic plates further back in time, as well as whether a supercontinent is assembling or breaking up. During the \textasciitilde 260–160Ma timeframe the model reaches a minima in the number of plates, in contrast to what we would expect during initial Pangea breakup and thus highlighting the need for refinement of the relative plate motion model. Continental and plate RMS speeds show an overall increase backwards through time from \textasciitilde 200 to 365Ma, reaching a peak at 365Ma of {$>$}14 and {$>$}16cm/yr, respectively, compared to \textasciitilde 3 and \textasciitilde 5cm/yr, respectively, at present-day. The median value of trench motion remains close to, yet above 0cm/yr for most of the model timeframe, with a dominance in positive values reflecting a prevalence of trench retreat over advance. Trench advance speeds are excessive during the 370–160Ma period, reaching more than four times that observed at present-day. Extended periods of trench advance and global continental and plate RMS speeds that far exceed present-day values warrant further investigation. Future work should test whether alternative absolute reference frames or relative motions would mitigate these high speeds, while still being consistent with geologic and geophysical observations, or alternatively focus on identifying potential driving mechanisms to account for such rapid motions.},

  abstract = {Recent progress in plate tectonic reconstructions has seen models move beyond the classical idea of continental drift by attempting to reconstruct the full evolving configuration of tectonic plates and plate boundaries. A particular problem for the Neoproterozoic and Cambrian is that many existing interpretations of geological and palaeomagnetic data have remained disconnected from younger, better-constrained periods in Earth history. An important test of deep time reconstructions is therefore to demonstrate the continuous kinematic viability of tectonic motions across multiple supercontinent cycles. We present, for the first time, a continuous full-plate model spanning 1 Ga to the present-day, that includes a revised and improved model for the Neoproterozoic–Cambrian (1000–520 Ma) that connects with models of the Phanerozoic, thereby opening up pre-Gondwana times for quantitative analysis and further regional refinements. In this contribution, we first summarise methodological approaches to full-plate modelling and review the existing full-plate models in order to select appropriate models that produce a single continuous model. Our model is presented in a palaeomagnetic reference frame, with a newly-derived apparent polar wander path for Gondwana from 540 to 320 Ma, and a global apparent polar wander path from 320 to 0 Ma. We stress, though while we have used palaeomagnetic data when available, the model is also geologically constrained, based on preserved data from past-plate boundaries. This study is intended as a first step in the direction of a detailed and self-consistent tectonic reconstruction for the last billion years of Earth history, and our model files are released to facilitate community development.},

  abstract = {GPlates is an open-source, cross-platform plate tectonic geographic information system, enabling the interactive manipulation of plate-tectonic reconstructions and the visualization of geodata through geological time. GPlates allows the building of topological plate models representing the mosaic of evolving plate boundary networks through time, useful for computing plate velocity fields as surface boundary conditions for mantle convection models and for investigating physical and chemical exchanges of material between the surface and the deep Earth along tectonic plate boundaries. The ability of GPlates to visualize subsurface 3-D scalar fields together with traditional geological surface data enables researchers to analyze their relationships through geological time in a common plate tectonic reference frame. To achieve this, a hierarchical cube map framework is used for rendering reconstructed surface raster data to support the rendering of subsurface 3-D scalar fields using graphics-hardware-accelerated ray-tracing techniques. GPlates enables the construction of plate deformation zones—regions combining extension, compression, and shearing that accommodate the relative motion between rigid blocks. Users can explore how strain rates, stretching/shortening factors, and crustal thickness evolve through space and time and interactively update the kinematics associated with deformation. Where data sets described by geometries (points, lines, or polygons) fall within deformation regions, the deformation can be applied to these geometries. Together, these tools allow users to build virtual Earth models that quantitatively describe continental assembly, fragmentation and dispersal and are interoperable with many other mapping and modeling tools, enabling applications in tectonics, geodynamics, basin evolution, orogenesis, deep Earth resource exploration, paleobiology, paleoceanography, and paleoclimate.},

  abstract = {Significant warming of Earth's climate in the near term seems increasingly likely. If significant enough, this climatic regime could, in the long term, come to resemble previous greenhouse intervals in earth history. Consequently, analysis of the fossil record during periods of extreme warmth may provide important lessons for species biology, including biogeography, in a much warmer world. To explore this issue, we analyzed the biogeographic response of 63 molluscan species to the long-term global warmth in the Late Cretaceous Western Interior Seaway (WIS) of North America, using Geographic Information Systems (GIS) to quantitatively measure changes in range size and distribution throughout this interval. We specifically considered the role that geographic range size played in mediating extinction resistance and invasion potential of these WIS species. We found no relationship between geographic range size and survivorship. However, endemic species with small range sizes were more likely to become invasive. Finally, mollusks did not experience a poleward shift in range out of the tropics during this warm regime. To the extent that these patterns are representative, and the WIS and taxa considered constitute a reasonable ancient analogue to a warmer future world, these results suggest that some biogeographic “rules” may not prevail under greenhouse conditions of long-term, equable warmth. They also suggest that other factors beyond geographic range size, including distinctive niche characteristics, may play quite important roles in species survival and invasion potential. This potentially complicates predictions regarding the future responses of extant species to long-term warming.},

Although developed by biologists and used extensively in the modern, ENM is in its early stages of application to the deep-time fossil record (hence PaleoENM). In part its limited use in the fossil record thus far reflects the methodological challenge of constructing paleoenvironmental layers needed for PaleoENM analysis, whereas in the modern these layers are available from large public databases (e.g., WorldClim).

The prevalence of competitive interactions and species replacements in the fossil record has long been investigated and many evolutionary perspectives, including those of Darwin, have emphasized the importance of competitive interactions that ultimately lead one species to replace another. However, evidence for such phenomena in the fossil record is not always manifest. Here we use new quantitative analytical techniques based on Geographical Information Systems and PaleoGIS tectonic reconstructions to consider this issue in greater detail. The abundant, well-preserved fossil marine vertebrates of the Late Cretaceous Western Interior Seaway of North America provide the component data for this study. Statistical analysis of distributional and range size changes in taxa confirms earlier ideas that the relative frequency of competitive replacement in the fossil record is limited to non-existent. It appears that typically, environmental gradients played the primary role in determining species distributions, with competitive interactions playing a more minor role.},

The common ontogenetic trajectories of septal spacing show a cycle comprising an increase and a subsequent decrease in septal spacing during early ontogeny.

Spherical impressions of spherules at the top of the Cretaceous indicate nearly instantaneous deposition of ejecta from the Chicxulub impact. The thickest ejecta layer shows clearly that a single impact occurred precisely at K-T boundary time.Above the spherule layer, the glauconitic clay contains the planktonic foraminiferal P0 and P-alpha Zones, indicating (1) a complete K-T succession and (2) continuous deposition interrupted only by fallout of the ejecta layer. Clay clasts within a 6 cm interval above the spherule layer contain Cretaceous microfossils and may be rip-up clasts from a tsunami or possibly a megastorm event. Extinction of the Cretaceous planktonic foraminifers and burrowing organisms occurs abruptly at the K-T boundary.

We show that plotting a noisy numerator divided by time versus time leads to the observed hyperbolic pattern; in fact, randomizing the amount of change over time generates patterns functionally identical to observed patterns. Ignoring errors can not only obscure true patterns but create novel patterns that have long misled scientists.},

Here we assess the relationship between body size and extinction using a data set comprising the body sizes, stratigraphic ranges, and occurrence patterns of 9408 genera of fossil marine animals spanning eight Linnaean classes across the past 485 Myr. We find that preferential extinction of smaller-bodied genera within classes is substantially more common than expected due to chance and that there is little evidence for preferential extinction of larger-bodied genera. Using a capture–mark–recapture analysis, we find that this size bias of extinction persists even after accounting for a pervasive bias against the sampling of smaller-bodied genera within classes. The size bias in extinction also persists after including geographic range as an additional predictor of extinction, indicating that correlation between body size and geographic range does not provide a simple explanation for the association between size and extinction. Regardless of the underlying causes, the preferential extinction of smaller-bodied genera across many higher taxa and most of geologic time indicates that the selective loss of large-bodied animals is the exception, rather than the rule, in the evolution of marine animals.},

  abstract = {Wide geographic range is generally thought to buffer taxa against extinction, but the strength of this effect has not been investigated for the great majority of the fossil record. Although the majority of genus extinctions have occurred between major mass extinctions, little is known about extinction selectivity regimes during these “background” intervals. Consequently, the question of whether selectivity regimes differ between background and mass extinctions is largely unresolved. Using logistic regression, we evaluated the selectivity of genus survivorship with respect to geographic range by using a global database of fossil benthic marine invertebrates spanning the Cambrian through the Neogene periods, an interval of ≈500 My. Our results show that wide geographic range has been significantly and positively associated with survivorship for the great majority of Phanerozoic time. Moreover, the significant association between geographic range and survivorship remains after controlling for differences in species richness and abundance among genera. However, mass extinctions and several second-order extinction events exhibit less geographic range selectivity than predicted by range alone. Widespread environmental disturbance can explain the reduced association between geographic range and extinction risk by simultaneously affecting genera with similar ecological and physiological characteristics on global scales. Although factors other than geographic range have certainly affected extinction risk during many intervals, geographic range is likely the most consistently significant predictor of extinction risk in the marine fossil record.},

  abstract = {Ecological theory predicts an inverse association between population size and extinction risk, but most previous paleontological studies have failed to confirm this relationship. The reasons for this discrepancy between theory and observation remain poorly understood. In this study, we compiled a global database of gastropod occurrences and collection-level abundances spanning the Early Permian through Early Jurassic (Pliensbachian). Globally, the database contains 5469 occurrences of 496 genera and 2156 species from 839 localities. Within the database, 30 collections distributed across seven stages contain at least 75 specimens and ten genera—our minimum criteria for within-collection analysis of extinction selectivity. We use logistic regression analysis, based on global and local measures of population size and stage-level extinction patterns in Early Permian through Early Jurassic marine gastropods, to assess the relationship between abundance and extinction risk. We find that global genus occurrence frequency is inversely associated with extinction risk (i.e., positively associated with survival) in 15 of 16 stages examined, statistically significantly so in five stages. Although correlation between geographic range and occurrence frequency may account for some of this association, results from multivariable regression analysis suggest that the association between occurrence frequency and extinction risk is largely independent of geographic range. Within local assemblages, abundance (number of individuals) is also inversely associated with extinction risk. The strength of association is consistent across time and modes of fossil preservation. Effect strength is poorly constrained, particularly in analyses of local collections. In addition to limited power due to small sample size, this poor constraint may result from confounding by ecological variables not controlled for in the analyses, by taphonomic or collection biases, or from non-monotonic relationships between abundance and extinction risk. Two factors are likely to account for the difference between our results and those of most previous studies. First, many previous studies focused on the end-Cretaceous mass extinction event; the extent to which these results can be generalized to other intervals remains unclear. Second, previous findings of nonselective extinction could result from insufficient statistical power rather than the absence of an underlying effect, because nonselective extinction is generally used as the null hypothesis for statistical convenience. Survivorship patterns in late Paleozoic and early Mesozoic gastropods suggest that abundance has been a more important influence on extinction risk through the Phanerozoic than previously appreciated.}

  abstract = {, A central question in the study of mass extinction is whether these events simply intensify background extinction processes and patterns versus change the driving mechanisms and associated patterns of selectivity. Over the past two decades, aided by the development of new fossil occurrence databases, selectivity patterns associated with mass extinction have become increasingly well quantified and their differences from background patterns established. In general, differences in geographic range matter less during mass extinction than during background intervals, while differences in respiratory and circulatory anatomy that may correlate with tolerance to rapid change in oxygen availability, temperature, and pH show greater evidence of selectivity during mass extinction. The recent expansion of physiological experiments on living representatives of diverse clades and the development of simple, quantitative theories linking temperature and oxygen availability to the extent of viable habitat in the oceans have enabled the use of Earth system models to link geochemical proxy constraints on environmental change with quantitative predictions of the amount and biogeography of habitat loss. Early indications are that the interaction between physiological traits and environmental change can explain substantial proportions of observed extinction selectivity for at least some mass extinction events. A remaining challenge is quantifying the effects of primary extinction resulting from the limits of physiological tolerance versus secondary extinction resulting from the loss of taxa on which a given species depended ecologically. The calibration of physiology-based models to past extinction events will enhance their value in prediction and mitigation efforts related to the current biodiversity crisis.},

Here, we quantify global and local extinction risks in the ocean across a range of climate futures on the basis of the ecophysiological limits of diverse animal species and calibration against the fossil record. With accelerating greenhouse gas emissions, species losses from warming and oxygen depletion alone become comparable to current direct human impacts within a century and culminate in a mass extinction rivaling those in Earth’s past. Polar species are at highest risk of extinction, but local biological richness declines more in the tropics. Reversing greenhouse gas emissions trends would diminish extinction risks by more than 70\%, preserving marine biodiversity accumulated over the past \textasciitilde 50 million years of evolutionary history.},

Compared to mass extinctions, background extinctions have received little attention. To disentangle the different contributions of global climate state, continental configuration, and atmospheric oxygen concentration (pO2) to variations in background extinction rates, we drive an animal physiological model with the environmental outputs from an Earth system model across intervals spanning the past 541 million years. We find that climate and continental configuration combined to make extinction susceptibility an order of magnitude higher during the Early Paleozoic than during the rest of the Phanerozoic, consistent with extinction rates derived from paleontological databases. The high extinction susceptibility arises in the model from the limited geographical range of marine organisms. It stands even when assuming present-day pO2, suggesting that increasing oxygenation through the Paleozoic is not necessary to explain why extinction rates apparently declined with time.},

An extraterrestrial signature marking the K—Pg boundary is confirmed by anomalously high amounts of iridium (up to 9.8 ppb) and other siderophile elements (especially Au and Ni), as well as by an elevated Ir/Au ratio consistent with a chondrite meteoritic composition. The major positive iridium spike surprisingly occurs in Maastrichtian marls, 10 cm below the boundary clay interval, which can be explained by diagenetic mobilisation and re-concentration of the impact-derived components. Thus, intensively infiltrating, humic acid-rich ground waters during the long-lasting Palaeogene weathering in tropical humid regimes were probably responsible not only for the large-scale decalcification of the Lechówka section, but also for both downward displaced position of the iridium enrichment, a dispersed profile of this anomaly and its significantly lessened value, but still approaching an increase by a factor of 100. This modified record of the K—Pg boundary event points to a careful reconsideration of the iridium anomaly as a trustworthy marker for studying the extinction patterns across the K—Pg boundary, as supported by the recent data from New Jersey, USA.},

We find that a global power imbalance persists in palaeontology, with researchers in high- or upper-middle-income countries holding a monopoly over palaeontological knowledge production by contributing to 97\% of fossil data. As a result, some countries or regions tend to be better sampled than others, ultimately leading to heterogeneous spatial sampling across the globe.

There are good indications for a planktonic mode of life of ammonoid hatchlings, but a broad range of reproductive strategies might have existed (egg-laying, fecundity). Isotope and biogeographical studies indicate that some forms migrated or swam for considerable distances, whereas others may have been primarily transported by oceanic currents during early and/or late ontogeny. Diverse ammonoid habitats are also supported by evidence from predator–prey relationships derived from characteristic injuries and exceptional fossil finds, which indicate chiefly predatory or scavenging lifestyles. Sublethal injuries preserved in some ammonoid shells, as well as rare stomach and coprolite contents, provide evidence of predation by other cephalopods, arthropods and various jawed vertebrates. Various lines of evidence suggest that different groups of ammonoids had quite different ecologies, but shell shape alone can only give upper constraints on ammonoid capabilities, a matter that needs to be considered when interpreting their diversity and evolutionary history.},

Recent research has demonstrated that ammonites lived at these sites. However, it is still unknown if they hatched at the seeps or only arrived there later in ontogeny. To answer this question, we documented the abundance and size distribution of small specimens of Baculites and Hoploscaphites at eight seep sites in the Pierre Shale of South Dakota. The specimens of Hoploscaphites range from 0.8 to 8.1 mm in shell diameter, with most of them falling between 1 and 1.5 mm. The specimens of Baculites range from 0.7 to 19.2 mm in length, with most specimens falling between 6 and 8 mm. The small size and morphology of these specimens indicate that they are neanoconchs, that is, newly hatched individuals that lived for a short time after hatching. We also analyzed the isotope composition (d13C and d18O) of 12 small specimens of Baculites and one specimen of Hoploscaphites with excellent shell preservation from one seep deposit. The values of d13C and d18O range from -16.3 to -2.5\% and -3.0 to -0.9\%, respectively. The values of d18O translate into temperatures of 19–288C, which are comparable to previous estimates of the temperatures of the Western Interior Seaway. The low values of d13C suggest that the tiny animals incorporated carbon derived from anaerobic oxidation of 12C-enriched methane into their shells. Evidently, they must have lived in close proximity to seep fluids emerging at the sediment-water interface and the associated microbial food web. However, this may have contributed to their demise if they were exposed to elevated concentrations of H2S derived from the anaerobic oxidation of methane.},

  abstract = {Many higher level avian clades are restricted to Earth’s lower latitudes, leading to historical biogeographic reconstructions favoring a Gondwanan origin of crown birds and numerous deep subclades. However, several such “tropical-restricted” clades (TRCs) are represented by stem-lineage fossils well outside the ranges of their closest living relatives, often on northern continents. To assess the drivers of these geographic disjunctions, we combined ecological niche modeling, paleoclimate models, and the early Cenozoic fossil record to examine the influence of climatic change on avian geographic distributions over the last ∼56 million years. By modeling the distribution of suitable habitable area through time, we illustrate that most Paleogene fossil-bearing localities would have been suitable for occupancy by extant TRC representatives when their stem-lineage fossils were deposited. Potentially suitable habitat for these TRCs is inferred to have become progressively restricted toward the tropics throughout the Cenozoic, culminating in relatively narrow circumtropical distributions in the present day. Our results are consistent with coarse-scale niche conservatism at the clade level and support a scenario whereby climate change over geological timescales has largely dictated the geographic distributions of many major avian clades. The distinctive modern bias toward high avian diversity at tropical latitudes for most hierarchical taxonomic levels may therefore represent a relatively recent phenomenon, overprinting a complex biogeographic history of dramatic geographic range shifts driven by Earth’s changing climate, variable persistence, and intercontinental dispersal. Earth’s current climatic trajectory portends a return to a megathermal state, which may dramatically influence the geographic distributions of many range-restricted extant clades.},

This paper utilizes the Pliocene to Recent fossil record of mollusks to identify determinants of species' extinction over the past three million years of Earth history. Location Western Atlantic. Methods We focus on 92 bivalve and gastropod species that lived during the mid-Pliocene Warm Period (mPWP; ∼3.264–3.025 Ma) and have either since gone extinct or are still extant. We used ecological niche modeling (ENM) to assess the vulnerability of these species to extinction as a function of both fundamental (FN) and realized (RN) niche breadth proxies, geographic range size, and amount of suitable area available to them during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM; ∼21 Ka). Results Geographic range size emerged as a key predictor of extinction for the studied mollusk species, with RN breadth and amount of suitable area available during the LGM as secondary predictors. By contrast, FN breadth was not a significant predictor of extinction risk. Main conclusions The failure to recover FN breadth as a predictor of extinction may suggest that extinction resistance is achieved when species are more successful in filling the geographic extent of their fundamental tolerances. That is, when it comes to species' survival, being a generalist or specialist sensu stricto may be secondary to the unique historical, dispersal, and biotic constraints that dictate a species' occupation of suitable environments, and consequently of geographic space, at a particular time. Identifying the factors that promote extinction is important because of the time-intensive nature of estimating extinction risk for individual species and populations, and because of the rising concerns about the future of marine ecosystems and biodiversity.},

  abstract = {Recent ecological theory depends, for predictive power, on the apparent similarity of metabolic rates within broad taxonomic or functional groups of organisms (e.g. invertebrates or ectotherms). Such metabolic commonality is challenged here, as I demonstrate more than 200-fold variation in metabolic rates independent of body mass and temperature in a single class of animals,the Cephalopoda, over seven orders of magnitude size range. I further demonstrate wide variation in the slopes of metabolic scaling curves. The observed variation in metabolism reflects differential selection among species for locomotory capacity rather than mass or temperature constraints. Such selection is highest among epipelagic squids (Lolignidae and Ommastrephidae)that, as adults, have temperature-corrected metabolic rates higher than mammals of similar size.},

  abstract = {Ammonites are among the best-known fossils of the Phanerozoic, yet their habitat is poorly understood. Three common ammonite families (Baculitidae, Scaphitidae, and Sphenodiscidae) co-occur with well-preserved planktonic and benthic organisms at the type locality of the upper Maastrichtian Owl Creek Formation, offering an excellent opportunity to constrain their depth habitats through isotopic comparisons among taxa. Based on sedimentary evidence and the micro- and macrofauna at this site, we infer that the 9-m-thick sequence was deposited at a paleodepth of 70–150 m. Taxa present throughout the sequence include a diverse assemblage of ammonites, bivalves, and gastropods, abundant benthic foraminifera, and rare planktonic foraminifera. No stratigraphic trends are observed in the isotopic data of any taxon, and thus all of the data from each taxon are considered as replicates. Oxygen isotope-based temperature estimates from the baculites and scaphites overlap with those of the benthos and are distinct from those of the plankton. In contrast, sphenodiscid temperature estimates span a range that includes estimates of the planktonic foraminifera and of the warmer half of the benthic values. These results suggest baculites and scaphites lived close to the seafloor, whereas sphenodiscids sometimes inhabited the upper water column and/or lived closer to shore. In fact, the rarity and poorer preservation of the sphenodiscids relative to the baculites and scaphites suggests that the sphenodiscid shells may have only reached the Owl Creek locality by drifting seaward after death.},

  abstract = {Lithified marine sediments are not equitably distributed through time, raising the possibility that lithification masks biological signals when data from unlithified and lithified sediments are compared or combined. Using mollusk-dominated assemblages from the early Cenozoic of the Gulf Coastal Plain, we find that lithification conceals small taxa, decreases taxonomic resolution, and exacerbates the undersampling of rare taxa. Lithified assemblages appear less diverse and have less even abundance distributions than coeval unlithified samples. These limitations cannot be overcome by standardization procedures, nor are they likely to be circumvented by collecting larger samples. The effects of this bias, however, can be mitigated by restricting analyses to a single lithification state or to specific size classes. Since lithification selectively obscures small taxa, the magnitude of this bias will be most severe when organisms are particularly small, such as in the aftermath of mass extinctions. In the study area, lithification artificially protracts the recovery period following the Cretaceous-Paleogene mass extinction by \textasciitilde 7 m.y.},

  abstract = {The evolving mosaic of tectonic plates across the surface of the Earth sets boundary conditions for the evolution of biotic and abiotic processes and helps shape the dynamics of its interior. Reconstructing plate tectonics back through time allows scientists from a range of disciplines (such as palaeobiology, palaeoclimate, geodynamics and seismology) to investigate Earth evolution through these spatiotemporal dimensions. However, the variety and complexity of plate reconstructions can lead to some of their limitations being overlooked. In this Technical Review, we discuss the domain-specific knowledge underpinning modern quantitative plate reconstructions and convey a set of principles on how to use (but not abuse) the software or results. Open-source plate tectonic reconstruction software, like GPlates, has led to a major shift in working practices, handing non-specialists the tools to develop and integrate reconstructions based on their own datasets and expertise. However, there is no ‘one-size-fits-all’ and users need to understand what data and underlying assumptions go into making different, sometimes competing reconstruction models. It is therefore essential to consider the many ways reconstructions simplify reality when interpreting them to avoid circular reasoning. Although many aspects of deep-time reconstructions remain unresolved, future work on intercomparisons between models and uncertainty quantification is an essential pathway towards next-generation plate reconstructions.},

It is suggested that the former species gave rise from the latter during the migration from the Gulf of Mexico to the Northwest Pacific region via the tropical eastern Pacific in the early Maastrichtian time. In the Northeastern Pacific region, T. pusillus sp. nov. could have survived at least until early late Maastrichtian time.},

  abstract = {Catastrophic hypotheses for mass extinctions are commonly criticized because many taxa gradually disappear from the fossil record prior to the extinction. Presumably, a geologically instantaneous catastrophe would not cause a reduction in diversity or a series of minor extinctions before the actual mass extinction. Two types of sampling effects, however, could cause taxa to appear to decline before their actual biotic extinction. The first of these is reduced sample size provided in the sedimentary record and the second, which we examine in greater detail, is artificial range truncation. The fossil record is discontinuous in time and the recorded ranges of species or of higher taxa can only extend to their last known occurrence in the fossil record. If the distribution of last occurrences is random with respect to actual biotic extinction, then apparent extinctions will begin well before a mass extinction and will gradually increase in frequency until the mass extinction event, thus giving the appearance of a gradual extinction. Other factors, such as regressions, can exacerbate the bias toward gradual disappearance of taxa from the fossil record. Hence, gradual extinction patterns prior to a mass extinction do not necessarily eliminate catastrophic extinction hypotheses. The recorded ranges of fossils, especially of uncommon taxa or taxa in habitats not represented by a continuous record, may be inadequate to test either gradual or catastrophic hypotheses.},

Contrary to expectations, our analyses reveal a nonlinear relationship between abundance and extinction rates, with rare and abundant genera exhibiting rates elevated over those of genera of moderate abundance. This U-shaped pattern is a persistent feature of the post-Paleozoic history of marine bivalves and provides one possible explanation for why we find strong support for heterogeneous extinction rates among genera grouped by similarity in abundance yet effectively no net relationship among these rates when using models of directional selection on abundance.}

The database is composed of 22 796 oxygen isotope values of phosphatic and calcareous fossils. The result shows two prolonged cooling events happened in the Late Paleozoic and Late Cenozoic, coinciding with two major ice ages indicated by continental glaciation data, and seven global warming events that happened in the Late Cambrian, Silurian-Devonian transition, Late Devonian, Early Triassic, Toarcian, Late Cretaceous, and Paleocene-Eocene transition. The SSTs during these warming periods are about 5–30 °C higher than the present-day level. Oxygen contents of shallow seawater are calculated from temperature, salinity, and atmospheric oxygen. The results show that major dissolved oxygen valleys of surface seawater coincide with global warming events and ocean anoxic events. We propose that the combined effect of temperature and dissolved oxygen account for the long-term evolution of global oceanic redox state during the Phanerozoic.},

We analyzed two K-Pg proximal sections, located in the Mississippi Embayment, Gulf Coastal Plain (USA), covering ?300~kyrs prior to and ?3~myrs after the K-Pg event. The OM abundance and composition changed dramatically across the boundary. The post-impact ejecta layer and burrowed unit are characterized by an increase in the mass accumulation rate (MAR) of plant and soil biomarkers, including high-molecular-weight n-alkanes and C29 steranes as well as the BIT index, related to an erosive period which transported terrestrial OM to the ocean in the aftermath of the impact event. At the same time, MARs of putative aquatic biomarkers decrease (low-molecular-weight n-alkanes, C27 steranes and pristane and phytane), which suggests a collapse of the marine phytoplankton community. The increase of terrestrial OM to the ocean, during the first 280~kyrs after the Chicxulub impact event, is a combination of reworked kerogen, soil and some plant material. Crucially, within the latter part of this erosion period, only ?160~kyrs after the K-Pg do biomarkers return to distributions similar to those in the upper Cretaceous, although not to pre-impact MARs. Thus, our results suggest a long-term interval for the full sedimentary and ecological recovery of the non-fossilizing phytoplankton community after this event.},

Location Emphasis is on biogeographical patterns in the Appalachian basin and mid-continent of North America during the Devonian. Global palaeobiogeographical patterns of the Cambrian are also considered. Methods Palaeobiogeographical patterns are assessed within a GIS framework, including both direct range reconstruction and niche modelling methods, and within phylogenetic biogeographical analysis. Biogeographical patterns are considered within multiple clades of fossil invertebrates, including trilobites, crustaceans, brachiopods, and bivalves. Results GIS-based analysis (including niche modelling methods) of Devonian invertebrates demonstrates a tightly correlated relationship between sea-level rises and range expansion, dispersal events, and species invasions. The predominance of range expansion and species invasions during the Late Devonian reduced opportunities for vicariant speciation during this interval. Comparison of phylogenetic biogeographical patterns between Cambrian and Devonian trilobites allows discernment of the relative roles of tectonics and eustacy in driving biogeographical patterns. Main conclusions GIS analysis and phylogenetic biogeography are powerful tools for analysing the coevolution of the Earth and its biota. Analyses can identify episodes of vicariance and geo-dispersal and produce testable hypotheses for further analysis within the fossil record.},

Differences in the maintenance energy requirements of individual species therefore potentially predict extinction likelihood. If validated, this would comprise an important link between organismic ecology and macroevolutionary dynamics. To test this hypothesis, the BMRs of organisms within fossil species were determined using body size and temperature data, and considered in the light of species' survival and extinction through time. Our analysis focused on the high-resolution record of Pliocene to recent molluscs (bivalves and gastropods) from the Western Atlantic. Species-specific BMRs were calculated by measuring the size range of specimens from museum collections, determining ocean temperature using the HadCM3 global climate model, and deriving values based on relevant equations. Intriguingly, a statistically significant difference in metabolic rate exists between those bivalve and gastropod taxa that went extinct and those that survived throughout the course of the Neogene. This indicates that there is a scaling up from organismic properties to species survival for these communities. Metabolic rate could therefore represent an important metric for predicting future extinction patterns, with changes in global climate potentially affecting the lifespan of individuals, ultimately leading to the extinction of the species they are contained within. We also find that, at the assemblage level, there are no significant differences in metabolic rates for different time intervals throughout the entire study period. This may suggest that Neogene mollusc communities have remained energetically stable, despite many extinctions.},

The selective extinction of externally shelled cephalopods at the Cretaceous-Paleogene (K-Pg) mass extinction event (ammonoids versus nautiloids) is often studied, but its mechanism is still debated. We investigate the differences in metabolic rate between these two groups to further explore the causes of selective extinction. We use a novel metabolic proxy—the fraction of metabolic carbon in the stable carbon isotope ratio of shell material (Cmeta)—to determine metabolic rate. Using this approach, we document significant differences in Cmeta among modern cephalopod taxa (Nautilus spp., Argonauta argo, Dosidicus gigas, Sepia officinalis, and Spirula spirula). Our results are consistent with estimates based on oxygen consumption, suggesting that this proxy is a reliable indicator of metabolic rate. We then use this approach to determine the metabolic rates of ammonoids and nautiloids that lived at the end of the Cretaceous (Maastrichtian). Our results show that the nautiloid Eutrephoceras, which survived the K-Pg mass extinction event, possessed a lower metabolic rate than co-occurring ammonoids (Baculites, Eubaculites, Discoscaphites, and Hoploscaphites). We conclude that the lower metabolic rate in nautiloids was an advantage during a time of environmental deterioration (surface-water acidification and resulting decrease in plankton) following the Chicxulub asteroid impact.},

  abstract = {Reconstructing the physiology of extinct organisms is key to understanding mechanisms of selective extinction during biotic crises. Soft tissues of extinct organisms are rarely preserved and, therefore, a proxy for physiological aspects is needed. Here, we examine whether cephalopod conchs yield information about their physiology by assessing how the formation of chambers respond to external stimuli such as environmental changes. We measured chamber volume through ontogeny to detect differences in the pattern of chamber volume development in nautilids, coleoids, and ammonoids. Results reveal that the differences between ontogenetic trajectories of these cephalopods involve the presence or absence of abrupt decreases of chamber volume. Accepting the link between metabolic rate and growth, we assume that this difference is rooted in metabolic rates that differ between cephalopod clades. High metabolic rates combined with small hatching size in ammonoids as opposed to lower metabolic rates and much larger hatchlings in most nautilids may explain the selective extinction of ammonoids as a consequence of low food availability at the end of the Cretaceous.},

  abstract = {Phenotypic intraspecific variation of organisms is essential for evolution and, thus, has the potential to provide crucial insights into evolutionary dynamics. Additionally, ontogeny is often intricately linked with the evolutionary trajectories of organisms. In this study, we explore the relationship between the magnitude and ontogenetic pattern of intraspecific variation, and the interrelationships of organisms, their geographic distribution, and species duration. We analyzed the intraspecific variation in the whorl expansion rate (WER) of several Late Cretaceous ammonoid species, including Hypophylloceras ramosum, Phyllopachyceras ezoense, Gaudryceras tenuiliratum, Tetragonites glabrus, T. popetensis, Damesites damesi, Tragodesmoceroides subcostatus, Subprionocyclus minimus, Yezoites puerculus (all from Hokkaido, Japan), as well as Scaphites whitfieldi and Hoploscaphites comprimus (both from North America). Our results reveal a weak to moderate, negative correlation between the magnitude of intraspecific variation and geographic distribution. The correlation between intraspecific variation and species duration is weak. Notably, scaphitid and phylloceratid ammonoids exhibit a higher degree of intraspecific variation compared to other species, although no significant differences are apparent within each family. Additionally, scaphitid species from both Japan and North America display similar ontogenetic patterns of intraspecific variation. Hypophylloceras ramosum exhibits a pattern of intraspecific variation, differing from other normally coiled ammonoids. In other taxa, the pattern among species cannot be distinguished. These discoveries suggest that intraspecific variation, geographic distribution, and species duration are, at least, not positively correlated. However, contrary to previous studies, our data suggest a potential link between intraspecific variation and the interrelationships of species (relative phylogenetic position). Further research involving the analysis of more taxa, multiple morphological parameters examined over longer ontogenetic stages, and the development of a robust phylogenetic hypothesis are necessary to better understand these associations.},

  abstract = {Hatching size has been considered of great importance in the evolution of externally shelled cephalopods. However, our knowledge of how hatching size varies in response to biotic and abiotic factors is largely lacking. We present a comprehensive overview of hatching size in all known species of modern nautilids (225 specimens, representing eight species). Hatching size ranges from 22 to 33 mm, with the smallest hatchlings in Nautilus pompilius suluensis and the largest hatchlings in Nautilus belauensis. There is no significant difference in hatching size between males and females in the same species. In addition, hatching size does not affect the morphology of the embryonic shell; smaller hatchlings are identical in morphology to larger hatchlings in the same species. Although information pertaining to temperature and duration of embryonic development are limited, we conclude that there is no clear correlation between hatching size and the temperature at which embryonic development takes place. In contrast, there is a weak correlation between hatching size and the duration of embryonic development. In the Late Cretaceous nautilid Eutrephoceras for which data on hatching size are available, species in colder climates exhibit a larger hatching size than those in more temperate climates. A comparison of hatching size and adult size among modern nautilid species reveals a positive correlation, largely driven by N. pompilius suluensis, at one end of the spectrum, and N. belauensis, at the other. This relationship may be rooted in parental care strategy and/or predation pressure. Keywords Cephalopods nautiloids evolution development ecology body size},

Because of their extreme ontogenetic size increase by up to three orders of magnitude, their position in the food webs likely changed during ontogeny. Here, we reconstruct the number of eggs laid by large adult females of these cephalopods and discuss developmental shifts in their ecologic roles. Based on similarities in conch morphology, size, habitat and abundance, we suggest that similar niches occupied in the Cretaceous by juvenile ammonites and belemnites were vacated during the extinction and later partially filled by holoplanktonic gastropods. As primary consumers, these extinct cephalopod groups were important constituents of the plankton and a principal food source for planktivorous organisms. As victims or, respectively, profiteers of this case of ecological replacement, filter feeding chondrichthyans and cetaceans likely filled the niches formerly occupied by large pachycormid fishes during the Jurassic and Cretaceous.},

The ontogenetic trajectories of septal spacing in the examined three species demonstrate a general common trend: a cycle of increasing to decreasing septal spacing until \textasciitilde 10th–16th septum. At the end of this cycle, desmoceratine ammonoids possibly changed their habits from planktic to various modes of life (e.g. demersal with or without diurnal vertical migrations), considering the theoretical calculation of total density in seawater in previous reports. The results suggest that: 1, the desmoceratine ammonoids had a common pattern of septal spacing during the post-embryonic stage, regardless of geological age or region; and 2, the shell diameter at which the planktic mode of life ended was almost uniform (\textasciitilde 1.5–2 mm in shell diameter) for \textasciitilde 30 my (i.e. during the Albian–earliest Campanian) within the Cretaceous lineage of the subfamily Desmoceratinae.

The jaws were preserved in calcareous nodules either in situ in body chambers of ammonites or in close association with identifiable ammonite conch remains. From the morphologic similarity between in situ and isolated jaws, they may be attributed to Tetragonites glabrus, Gaudryceras tenuiliratum, G. denseplicatum, G. sp., and Neophylloceras subramosum. The jaw apparatus of these species is composed of two three‐dimensional black walls of carbonate apatite, which might be a diagenetic replacement of chitinous material. The calcareous coverings in both upper and lower jaws closely resemble those of upper (rhyncholite) and lower (conchorhynch) jaws of modern Nautilus as well as rhyncholite and conchorhynch fossils in their gross morphology, microstructure, and chemical composition. Calcified remains of cephalopod jaws known as rhyncholites and conchorhynchs have been reported from late Paleozoic to Recent. The present discovery of ammonoid rhyncholites and conchorhynchs suggests that at least some previously known late Paleozoic and Mesozoic counterparts belong to the Ammonoidea. The essential similarity of jaw elements of some Late Cretaceous ammonites and modern Nautilus gives reliable information on the feeding habits of the former.

  abstract = {Metabolic rates are fundamental to many biological processes, and commonly scale with body size with an exponent (bR) between 2/3 and 1 for reasons still debated. According to the ‘metabolic-level boundaries hypothesis', bR depends on the metabolic level (LR). We test this prediction and show that across cephalopod species intraspecific bR correlates positively with not only LR but also the scaling of body surface area with body mass. Cephalopod species with high LR maintain near constant mass-specific metabolic rates, growth and probably inner-mantle surface area for exchange of respiratory gases or wastes throughout their lives. By contrast, teleost fish show a negative correlation between bR and LR. We hypothesize that this striking taxonomic difference arises because both resource supply and demand scale differently in fish and cephalopods, as a result of contrasting mortality and energetic pressures, likely related to different locomotion costs and predation pressure. Cephalopods with high LR exhibit relatively steep scaling of growth, locomotion, and resource-exchange surface area, made possible by body-shape shifting. We suggest that differences in lifestyle, growth and body shape with changing water depth may be useful for predicting contrasting metabolic scaling for coexisting animals of similar sizes.

The biological and oceanographic consequences of the mass extinction are, however, still poorly understood. According to the Living Ocean model, the biological crisis at the K–Pg boundary resulted in a long-term reduction of export productivity in the early Paleocene. Here, we combine organic-walled dinoflagellate cyst (dinocyst) and benthic foraminiferal analyses to provide new insights into changes in the coupling of pelagic and benthic ecosystems. To this end, we perform dinocyst and benthic foraminiferal analyses on the recently discovered Tethyan K–Pg boundary section at Okçular, Turkey, and compare the results with other K–Pg boundary sites in the Tethys. The post-impact dominance of epibenthic morphotypes and an increase of inferred heterotrophic dinocysts in the early Paleocene at Okçular are consistent with published records from other western Tethyan sites. Together, these records indicate that during the early Paleocene more nutrients remained available for the Tethyan planktonic community, whereas benthic communities were deprived of food. Hence, in the post-impact phase the reduction of export productivity likely resulted in enhanced recycling of nutrients in the upper part of the water column, all along the western Tethyan margins.},

Outcrops in the Maastrichtian type area (south-east Netherlands, north-east Belgium) comprise a stratigraphically expanded K/Pg boundary succession that offers a unique opportunity to study marine ecosystem recovery within the first few thousand years following the mass extinction event. A quantitative analysis was performed on systematically sampled macrofossils of the topmost Maastrichtian and lowermost Danian strata at the former Ankerpoort-Curfs quarry (Geulhem), which represent ?snapshots? of the latest Cretaceous and earliest Palaeogene marine ecosystems, respectively. Molluscs in particular are diverse and abundant in the studied succession. Regional ecosystem changes across the K/Pg boundary are relatively minor, showing a decline in suspension feeders, accompanied by an ecological shift to endobenthic molluscs. The earliest Paleocene gastropod assemblage retains many ?Maastrichtian? features and documents a fauna that temporarily survived into the Danian. The shallow, oligotrophic carbonate platform in this area was inhabited by taxa that were adapted to low nutrient levels and resistant to starvation. As a result, the local taxa were less affected by the short-lived detrimental conditions related to K/Pg boundary perturbations, such as darkness, cooling, starvation and ocean acidification. This resulted in relatively high survival rates, which enabled rapid recolonization and recovery of marine faunas in the Maastrichtian type area.},

  abstract = {Abstract: This paper provides an outline of Cretaceous stratigraphy and paleogeography in China, which is based on rich data obtained from recent researches. Cretaceous deposits are widespread in China. Most strata are of nonmarine origin and marine sediments occur only in Tibet, western Tarim Basin of Xinjiang, Taiwan and limited localities of eastern Heilongjiang. All deposits are rich in fossils and well-constrained biostratigraphically. The stratigraphic successions of different regions are illustrated, and general stratigraphic division and correlation have been introduced. The marine deposits are described in the Tibetan Tethys, Kashi-Hotan Region of Xinjiang, eastern Heilongjiang, western Yunnan and Taiwan; the nonmarine deposits are outlined from northeast China, southeast China, southern interior China, southwest China, the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia region, and northwestern China intermontane basins. The sedimentary facies and paleogeography are diversified. In Tibet the basin evolution is largely related to the subduction and collision of the Indian Plate against the Eurasian Continent, and shows a tectonic evolution in the Cretaceous. Foraminifera are a dominant biota in the Tibet Tethys. Nonmarine sediments include variegated and red beds, coal- or salt-bearing horizons, and volcanic rocks. These deposits contain diverse and abundant continental faunas and floras, as well as important coal and oil resources. The Cretaceous stratigraphy and paleogeography in China have presented a foundation for geological studies.},

Major faunal changes took place in Tibet during the Late Cretaceous. Ali of the Cretaceous ammonoids, planktonic and benthonic foraminifera, rudistid and inoceramid bivalves became extinct over the Campanian Maastrichtian interval in a stepwise pattern, with abrupt Late Campanian and Late Maastrichtian extinction events (Tabs. 3, 4). A large number of new taxa appeared during the Danian (Tabs. 3, 4). These faunal changes in the shallow-water marine facies of Tibet demonstrate that this region was not isolated from major global faunal changes taking place in the Cretaceous/Tertiary boundary mass extinction interval.},

  abstract = {Environmental stressors have exacerbated the collapse of marine ecosystems during mass extinctions. However, the survival strategies of marine species during mass extinctions remain unclear. Here, we investigated morphological evolution of brachiopods across the Permian–Triassic mass extinction (PTME) using a database of 3,225 specimens representing 1,061 species and foraminifera across the PTME and early Toarcian oceanic anoxic event (T-OAE) using a database of 757 specimens representing 12 species. We found a significant reduction in the number and proportion (plicae length/shell length) of shell plicae of brachiopods (36.4\% and 60.0\%, respectively) across the PTME and a significant decrease in the shell thickness of foraminifera (18.9\% and 42.4\% across the PTME and 36.9–61.8\% across the T-OAE). We calculated that these adaptive strategies could reduce the energetic costs of calcification by more than half for brachiopods across the PTME, and by \textasciitilde 20–62\% for foraminifera across the PTME and T-OAE, to compensate for the elevated cost of calcification due to environmental and ecological pressures. We propose that simplification of morphological features, such as reduced shell ornamentation and shell thinning, serves as a potential economic strategy for calcifying organisms to cope with extinction events by reducing energy demands, but further studies with a broader range of taxa and extinction events are needed to confirm the generality of this bioenergetic strategy.},

Here we describe two improvements to Marshall's method. First, we show that more precise estimates of the position of such a boundary may be obtained using range extensions with confidence levels of less than 50\% (e.g., 20\%). Second, we introduce a new method of calculating confidence intervals that explicitly takes into account the position of the highest fossil find. Incorporating these improvements leads to confidence intervals for simulated data sets that are approximately four times more precise than those obtained by using Marshall's (1995) original method and approximately twice as precise as those using other published methods. We provide a look-up table that shows for different numbers of taxa the confidence level that should be used to maximize the precision of the estimated position of the extinction boundary, while ensuring that the boundary still lies within the stratigraphic interval bounded by at least one range extension. Unlike some other methods, our method is nonparametric and does not make the restrictive assumption of uniform preservation and recovery potential. We apply the method to Macellari's (1986) ammonite data from the late Cretaceous of Seymour Island, Antarctica.},

The results show that (1) length of temporal ranges of ammonoids effected broader ranges of fossil distribution and paleobiogeography of ammonoids, and (2) the hatchling size was not related to the geographical range of fossil distribution of ammonoids. Reducing the influence of geological duration in this analysis implies that hatchling size was one of the controlling factors that determined the distribution of ammonoid habitats at any given period in time: ammonoids with smaller hatchling sizes tended to have broader ammonoid habitat ranges. These relationships were somewhat blurred in the Devonian, Carboniferous, Triassic, and Jurassic, which is possibly due to (1) the course of development of a reproductive strategy with smaller hatchling sizes in the Devonian and (2) the high origination rates after the mass extinction events.},

These new data for Hercoglossidae and the previously reported data for Nautilidae and Cymatoceratidae suggest that all Cretaceous nautiloids had large hatchlings irrespective of their taxonomy relative to those in ammonoids. Based on the relationship between hatching events and the nepionic constriction in modern nautili, the hatchling size of nautiloids can be recognized by the constriction on the shell surface of the innermost whorl. The range of hatchling diameter in all Cretaceous nautiloids (9–35~mm) is comparable to those of modern nautili (20–32 mm), although the Cretaceous nautiloids are characterized by a wider range with the smaller minimum diameter. The large hatchling size in Cretaceous nautiloids stands in marked contrast to those in ammonoids, which had much smaller hatchling size (mostly {$<$}2~mm in diameter) and became extinct at the end of the Cretaceous. Such distinct differences in reproductive strategy (i.e., hatchling and egg sizes) suggest that these differences may have played a significant role in the fate of ammonoids and nautiloids through the K/T mass extinction, as previously hypothesized by several paleontologists.},

The temporal changes of reconstructed hatchling habits during the Phanerozoic demonstrate planktic habits in ammonoids and a trend from planktic to non-planktic habits in nautiloids. The correlation of ammonoid richness with sea levels and the lack of correlation in nautiloids with nonplanktic hatchlings contradict the general theory that animals with planktic embryos or larvae have lower speciation rates and extinction probabilities. This contradiction in the fossil evidence of cephalopods suggests that sympatric speciation was a plausible dominant process of their macroevolution. This contradiction relative to prevalent theory, that allopatric speciation is the prevalent mode of speciation in modern animals, suggests that speciation is a more complicated process than previously thought.},

The areas occupied by the ammonites and nautilids are largely nonoverlapping when plotted as WD and DS graphs.The almost complete absence of overlap in Juro-Cretaceous ammonite and nautilid shell shape distributions is consistent with the view that ammonites and nautilids were dissimilar ecologically, and evolved different shell shapes in response to different adaptational needs. The terminal Cretaceous extinction of the ammonites may have opened up new opportunities for nautilid evolution during the Tertiary, because Tertiary nautilids are dominanted by moderately compressed, hydrodynamically efficient shell shapes which were rarely present among Jurassic and Cretacepus nautilids, but common among ammonites. The restriction of nautilids to a far more limited portion (compared to ammonites) of the theoretically available spectrum of planispiral shell shapes may be due in part to fabricational constraints imposed by the simple nautilid septum and septal suture. Nautilid shell shapes were limited to globular or slightly compressed to depressed shells, which are inherently strong due to pronounced shell wall curvature, and would be strengthened to only a small extent by buttressing from internal septa. Strongly depressed or compressed shell shapes, commonly evolved among ammonoids, had flattened shell regions which are inherently weak, and would be strengthened to a considerable extent by numerous thick, or strongly folded and fluted septa and septal sutures.},

  abstract = {Cephalopods are among many marine animals that through some combination of habit and/or habitat have proven difficult to study, especially understanding their trophic positions in marine communities. Stable isotope analyses have provided powerful tools for discovering quantitative aspects about the ecology and food sources of many cephalopod species. Here, we present new gut content and isotopic data (carbon and nitrogen isotopes) from phragmocone-bearing cephalopods (both ectocochleates, as well as those with internal, hard part buoyancy maintenance apparatuses). To this, we also include observations from baited remote underwater video systems to describe feeding habits and potential prey types to correlate with gut contents analyses. These data come from extant Allonautilus, Nautilus, and Sepia species, as well as from extinct nautiloids and ammonites. Extant nautiloids occupy a different isotopic niche than all other cephalopod groups where such data have been published to date. We conclude that these species are obligate scavengers rather than predators on any living species in their environments. Extant Nautilus and Allonautilus also demonstrate different patterns of functional allometry of nitrogen isotope values over ontogeny than do most other cephalopods (or animals in general), by showing decreasing nitrogen isotope levels during ontogeny. This pattern is shown to be different in Sepia and the yet small number of ammonite cephalopods studied to date, supporting the increasingly accepted view that ammonites were far closer to coleoids in basic biology than nautiloids. Overall, phragmocone-bearing cephalopods appear fundamentally different ecologically than cephalopods without this kind of buoyancy system. Of these groups, nautiloids appear to live a low-energy existence that allows them to subsist on energy-poor food sources, such as crustacean molts, as well as being able to scavenge in low oxygen basins where rare food falls, such as dead fish, remain unobtainable by most other animals.},

While a great research effort lasting from the mid-1970s to 1990s contributed vast amounts of new information concerning the evolutionary history, current diversity, mode of life, and ecological position in its habitats took place, since that time there has been far less concentrated research, and most of that has concerned the diversity and genetic distance of isolated populations using genetic techniques. In spite of the reprinting of one of the two 1987 books examining aspects of Nautilus biology, the only new field-based work on Nautilus until recently has been the important, Ph.D. thesis conducted by Andrew Dunstan on the isolated, seamount inhabiting nautiluses living on Osprey Reef, Australia. In this contribution we attempt to integrate Dunstan’s important new work with other, post-2010 research so as to update our current understanding of the evolutionary history (based on fossil as well as modern genetic work), characteristic habitats, mode of life, and physiology so as to give a 2015 perspective on those aspects of the natural history of Nautilus that are of paleobiological relevance.},

Here we present new occurrence and paleoecological information about these three taxa based on previously and newly collected specimens from Pebble Point Formation beds, as well as presenting the first paleotemperature analyses for Australian nautiloid cephalopods of any age. We sampled for shell carbonates from the single known specimen of 'Nautilus praepompililus', as well as from a specimen of 'Aturoidea distans' from the Pebble Point beds. The A. distans samples showed temperature of calcification to have been between 20 and 25 degrees C; and for 'N. praepompilius' the temperatures were between 18 and 21 degrees C. There were too few samples to provide statistical analyses, yet the implication is that these two taxa inhabited different depths during calcification. For comparison, we have sampled shell carbonates from the only known extant site where two different nautilid genera coexist, Manus Island, Papua New Guinea. There, specimens of 'Nautilus pompilius' and 'Allonautilus scrobiculatus' calcified (1984 specimens) at temperatures of 12 to 17 degrees C, conforming to previous measurements in the literature and significantly colder than any of the Paleocene specimens sampled here.},

  abstract = {Bootstrap methods are widely used in statistics, and bootstrapping of residuals can be especially useful in the regression context. However, difficulties are encountered extending residual resampling to regression settings where residuals are not identically distributed (thus not amenable to bootstrapping)—common examples including logistic or Poisson regression and generalizations to handle clustered or multivariate data, such as generalised estimating equations. We propose a bootstrap method based on probability integral transform (PIT-) residuals, which we call the PIT-trap, which assumes data come from some marginal distribution F of known parametric form. This method can be understood as a type of “model-free bootstrap”, adapted to the problem of discrete and highly multivariate data. PIT-residuals have the key property that they are (asymptotically) pivotal. The PIT-trap thus inherits the key property, not afforded by any other residual resampling approach, that the marginal distribution of data can be preserved under PIT-trapping. This in turn enables the derivation of some standard bootstrap properties, including second-order correctness of pivotal PIT-trap test statistics. In multivariate data, bootstrapping rows of PIT-residuals affords the property that it preserves correlation in data without the need for it to be modelled, a key point of difference as compared to a parametric bootstrap. The proposed method is illustrated on an example involving multivariate abundance data in ecology, and demonstrated via simulation to have improved properties as compared to competing resampling methods.},

  abstract = {The impact of increasing atmospheric CO2 and the resulting decreasing pH of seawater are in the focus of current environmental research. These factors cause problems for marine calcifiers such as reduced calcification rates and the dissolution of calcareous skeletons. While the impact on recent organisms is well established, little is known about long-term evolutionary consequences. Here, we assessed whether ammonoids reacted to environmental change by changing septal thickness. We measured the septal thickness of ammonoid phragmocones through ontogeny in order to test the hypothesis that atmospheric pCO2, seawater pH and other factors affected aragonite biomineralisation in ammonoids. Particularly, we studied septal thickness of ammonoids before and after the ocean acidification event in the latest Triassic until the Early Cretaceous. Early Jurassic ammonoid lineages had thinner septa relative to diameter than their Late Triassic relatives, which we tentatively interpret as consequence of a positive selection for reduced shell material as an evolutionary response to this ocean acidification event. This response was preserved within several lineages among the Early Jurassic descendants of these ammonoids. By contrast, we did not find a significant correlation between septal thickness and long-term atmospheric pCO2 or seawater pH, but we discovered a correlation with palaeolatitude.},

  abstract = {We report on new collections of cephalopods (ammonites and nautilids) from the Cretaceous-Paleogene (K-Pg) successions of the Corsicana and Kincaid formations exposed along the Brazos River in Falls County, Texas. An abundant fauna of eight species comprising four genera of ammonites is described from the Corsicana Formation, including Discoscaphites mullinaxorum n. sp. The presence of abundant aptychi (probably lower jaws) of Discoscaphites and Eubaculites, as well as juvenile specimens, indicates a living population that experienced little postmortem drift. The lytoceratid genus Gaudryceras is also reported for the first time from the Brazos River area. Presence of the index taxon Discoscaphites iris (Conrad, 1858) indicates that the fauna belongs to the D. iris Range Zone, the highest ammonite range zone in North America. Correlation with new and existing microfossil data indicates that the fauna represents the uppermost Maastrichtian, and comparison with published records further suggests that this is the most diverse D. iris Zone fauna yet reported from the Gulf and Atlantic Coastal Plains of North America. Three ammonite genera are recorded from the basal units of the K-Pg event deposit at Brazos, which likely represents deposition in the immediate aftermath of the Chicxulub impact event. A single specimen of the nautilid Eutrephoceras is reported from the Danian Kincaid Formation, less than 300 kyr after the K-Pg boundary. These data provide new information on the differing fate of these cephalopod groups during the K-Pg mass extinction and add to the picture of diverse and abundant Maastrichtian ammonite faunas prior to the Chicxulub impact event.},

Located at \textasciitilde 65° South now, and during the Cretaceous, this sequence is the highest southern latitude onshore outcrop containing the Cretaceous-Paleogene (K–Pg) transition. We present comprehensive new biostratigraphic range data for 14 ammonite and one nautiloid species based on the collection of {$>$}700 macrofossils from high-resolution sampling of parallel sedimentary sections, dated Maastrichtian to earliest Danian in age, across southern Seymour Island. We find evidence for only a single, abrupt pulse of cephalopod extinction at the end of the Cretaceous when the final seven ammonite species disappeared, consistent with most evidence globally. In the lead up to the K–Pg extinction in the James Ross Basin, starting during the Campanian, ammonite diversity decreased overall, but the number of endemic taxa belonging to the family Kossmaticeratidae actually increased. This pattern continued into the Maastrichtian and may be facies controlled, linked to changes in sea level and seawater temperature. During the early Maastrichtian, ammonite diversity dropped significantly with only two species recorded from the basal López de Bertodano Formation on Seymour Island. The subsequent diversification of endemic taxa and reappearance of long-ranging, widespread species into the basin resulted in an increase in ammonite diversity and abundance during the mid-Maastrichtian. This was coincident with an apparent period of warming temperatures and sea level rise interpreted from palynology and sedimentology, perhaps reflecting a high latitude expression of the Mid-Maastrichtian Event. Late Maastrichtian diversity levels remained stable despite reported climatic and environmental variation. Ammonite diversity patterns during the Maastrichtian parallel those of microfossil species such as nannofossil and planktonic foraminifera, suggesting that dynamic climatic and environmental changes affected many planktonic and nektonic organisms during the latest Cretaceous. However, we suggest that these perturbations had a minimal effect on overall diversity prior to the catastrophic extinction event at the K–Pg boundary.},

  abstract = {We describe an outcrop of the Cretaceous–Paleogene (K–Pg) boundary exposed due to construction near New Albany, Union County, Mississippi. It consists of the Owl Creek Formation and overlying Clayton Formation. The Owl Creek Formation is rich in the ammonites Discoscaphites iris and Eubaculites carinatus, which, along with biostratigraphically important dinoflagellate cysts and calcareous nannofossils, indicate deposition occurred within the last 1 million years, most likely last 500~kyrs, of the Cretaceous. The base of the overlying Clayton Formation marks the K–Pg boundary, and consists of a 15–30~cm thick muddy, poorly sorted quartz sand containing abundant spherules representing ejecta derived from the Chicxulub impact event. Impact spherules range in size from 0.5~mm to 1~mm in diameter and are hollow and well preserved, with details such as smaller vesicular spherules enclosed within. The spherules are altered to clay minerals such as smectite and are typical of those found at K–Pg boundary sites in the Gulf of Mexico and beyond. Spherules are scattered throughout the bed, and surface counts suggest an average of 4 spherules per cm2. Macrofossils within the spherule bed represent a rich fauna of ammonites, benthic molluscs (bivalves and gastropods), echinoids, as well as crabs and sharks. Macrofossil preservation ranges from whole to fragmentary, with most fossils preserved as internal moulds. The infill of the fossils is lithologically identical to the matrix of the spherule bed, including impact ejecta preserved within phragmocones and body chambers of ammonites, and differs from the underlying Owl Creek Formation. This suggests that the animals were either alive or loosely scattered on the sea floor at the time of deposition. Grain size changes indicate multiple events were responsible for deposition, and together with taphonomic evidence are consistent with dynamic high energy post-impact processes. Later sea level change during the Paleocene is responsible for a sharp contact at the top of the spherule bed. Geochemical evidence from the Owl Creek and Clayton Formations at this locality indicate numerous local paleoenvironmental changes affected the Mississippi Embayment at the time of the K–Pg boundary and mass extinction event.},

Our results suggest that the fossil record of D. iris is consistent with no within-species net accumulation of phyletic evolutionary change across morphological traits or the lifetime of this species. Correlations between some traits and paleoenvironmental conditions as well as changes in the coefficient of variation may support limited population-scale ecophenotypic plasticity; however, where stratigraphic data are available, no directional changes in morphology occur before the Cretaceous/Paleogene (K/Pg) boundary. This is consistent with models of “dynamic” evolutionary stasis. Combined with knowledge of life-history traits and paleoecology of scaphitid ammonoids, specifically a short planktonic phase after hatching followed by transition to a nektobenthic adult stage, these data suggest that scaphitids had significant potential for rapid morphological change in conjunction with limited dispersal capacity. It is therefore likely that evolutionary mode in the Scaphitidae (and potentially across the broader ammonoid clade) follows a model of cladogenesis wherein a dynamic morphological stasis is periodically interrupted by more substantial evolutionary change at speciation events. Finally, the lack of temporal changes in our data suggest that global environmental changes had a limited effect on the morphology of ammonoid faunas during the latest Cretaceous.},

  abstract = {Shell calcification in argonauts is unique. Only females of these cephalopods construct the paper nautilus shell, which is used as a brood chamber for developing embryos in the pelagic realm. As one of the thinnest (225 μm) known adult mollusc shells, and lacking an outer protective periostracum-like cover, this shell may be susceptible to dissolution as the ocean warms and decreases in pH. Vulnerability of the A. nodosa shell was investigated through immersion of shell fragments in multifactorial experiments of control (19 °C/pH 8.1; pCO2 419; ΩCa = 4.23) and near-future conditions (24 °C/pH 7.8–7.6; pCO2 932–1525; ΩCa = 2.72-1.55) for 14 days. More extreme pH treatments (pH 7.4–7.2; pCO2 2454–3882; ΩCa = 1.20-0.67) were used to assess tipping points in shell dissolution. X-ray diffractometry revealed no change in mineralogy between untreated and treated shells. Reduced shell weight due to dissolution was evident in shells incubated at pH 7.8 (projected for 2070) after 14 days at control temperature, with increased dissolution in warmer and lower pH treatments. The greatest dissolution was recorded at 24 °C (projected for local waters by 2100) compared to control temperature across all low-pH treatments. Scanning electron microscopy revealed dissolution and etching of shell mineral in experimental treatments. In the absence of compensatory mineralization, the uncovered female brood chamber will be susceptible to dissolution as ocean pH decreases. Since the shell was a crucial adaptation for the evolution of the argonauts’ holopelagic existence, persistence of A. nodosa may be compromised by shell dissolution in an ocean-change world.},

We present a methodology for ground-truthing the digital Palaeogeographic Atlas of Australia by linking the GPlates plate reconstruction tool to the global Paleobiology Database and a Phanerozoic plate motion model. We develop a spatio-temporal data mining workflow to validate the Phanerozoic Palaeogeographic Atlas of Australia with paleoenvironments derived from fossil data. While there is general agreement between fossil data and the paleogeographic model, the methodology highlights key inconsistencies. The Early Devonian paleogeographic model of southeastern Australia insufficiently describes the Emsian inundation that may be refined using biofacies distributions. Additionally, the paleogeographic model and fossil data can be used to strengthen numerical models, such as the dynamic topography and the associated inundation of eastern Australia during the Cretaceous. Although paleobiology data provide constraints only for paleoenvironments with high preservation potential of organisms, our approach enables the use of additional proxy data to generate improved paleogeographic reconstructions.},

  abstract = {Jurassic-Cretaceous (J-K) ammonoids experienced remarkably rapid rates of evolution and extinction. The processes that fueled this evolutionary volatility are not well understood. Evolutionary relationships among and within the six J-K ammonoid suborders are incompletely reconstructed, in part because the homeomorphy and intraspecific variability complicates phylogenetic analysis. J-K ammonoids appear to have been developmentally flexible; heterochronic shifts in their evolution are common and taxa are often distinguishable by variations in the timing of developmental events. Changes in environmental variables are consistently correlated with both diversification and extinction in J-K ammonoids. The tectonic separation of Pangea, greenhouse warming, and sea level change drove ammonoid dispersal and the development of biogeographic provinces. A synthetic view of J-K ammonoid evolution provides the foundation for a model of ammonoid speciation in which sea level change provides new epeiric sea microhabitats into which ammonoids disperse while developmental flexibility provides the morphological and ecological variation to fuel divergence and speciation. New quantitative and geospatial approaches will allow us to integrate phylogenetic and paleobiogeographic data to better understand the macroevolution of these cephalopods.},

  abstract = {Two end-member models are proposed to explain marine biotic responses to greenhouse conditions. Global warming and increasing sea level may: (1) promote dispersal of marine species, leading to larger geographic ranges and decreased speciation and biodiversity; or (2) result in formation of isolated epicontinental basins that host endemic radiations, leading to smaller geographic ranges and increased speciation and biodiversity. The Cenomanian–Turonian (C–T) interval, marked by greenhouse warming, sea-level rise, ocean anoxia, and biotic turnover, presents an opportunity to test these two end-member models. In particular, how cephalopods responded to these global changes has not been clear. A global database of 7262 cephalopod occurrences was used to evaluate biodiversity changes through the C–T interval. Both species- and genus-level diversity peaked in the late Cenomanian. The global diversity drop across the C/T boundary was modest; rather, diversity was low during the middle Cenomanian and middle Turonian, times of brief cooling. Regional variations in diversity responses may reflect the degree and timing of environmental perturbations within different oceanographic settings. Surprisingly, cephalopod faunas in the European Platform, Western Interior, and South Atlantic all shifted equatorward across the C/T boundary, whereas other regions saw no change in latitudinal distributions. Global generic geographic ranges did not change through the C–T interval, but the percentage of cosmopolitan genera did increase significantly across the C/T, both globally and within the Western Interior and Europe, whereas cosmopolitans dropped in the Pacific and South Atlantic. Neither end-member model for biodiversity change in a greenhouse world is supported for C–T cephalopods, as diversity increased without an associated increase in geographic range. It may be that sea-level rise and global warming led to both endemic radiations in epicontinental basins and an increase in cosmopolitan taxa in some regions, demonstrating the importance of combining global and regional-scale analyses.},

  abstract = {A basic hypothesis in extinction theory predicts that more abundant taxa have an evolutionary advantage over less abundant taxa, which should manifest as increased survivorship during major extinction events and longer fossil-record durations. Despite this, various paleontologic studies have found conflicting patterns, indicating a more complex relationship between abundance and extinction in the geologic past. This study tests the relationship between abundance and extinction among brachiopod genera within seven third-order depositional sequences spanning the Late Ordovician to Early Silurian (Katian–Aeronian) of the Cincinnati Arch.Contrary to predictions, abundance is not positively correlated with duration in this study. Abundance and duration range from strongly negatively correlated to uncorrelated depending on the spatial scale of analysis and the geologic intervals included, but correlations never indicate that abundance is an evolutionary advantage. In contrast, abundance was an advantageous trait prior to the Ordovician/Silurian extinction, and brachiopods with higher abundances were more likely to survive the event than less abundant brachiopods. While this result is in keeping with common models of extinction, it has not been observed previously at a mass extinction boundary. This may be further evidence that the Ordovician/Silurian extinction was not accompanied by a shift in the macroevolutionary selectivity regime.}

  abstract = {The discovery of a fish bone layer immediately overlying the K-T iridium anomaly on Seymour Island, Antarctic Peninsula, which may represent the first documented mass kill associated with the impact event, together with new faunal data across the boundary has provided new insight into events at the end of the Cretaceous. The utilization of a geographical approach and a new graphical representation of range data has revealed that events at the end of the Cretaceous were not instantaneous, but occurred over a finite period of time. Although the fish bone layer may contain victims of the impact event, the absence of ammonites in either the iridium-bearing layer or the overlying fish layer suggests that the extinction event at the end of the Cretaceous was the culmination of several processes beginning in the late Campanian. The impact was the proverbial "straw that broke the camel's back," leading to the extinction of many others forms of life that might have survived the period of global biotic stress during the waning stages of the Mesozoic if there had not been an impact. The absence of mass extinction following catastrophic geologic events in a biotic robust world, such as the Middle Ordovician Millbrig-Big Bentonite volcanic event suggests that the biosphere is remarkably resilient to major geologic catastrophes with mass extinction events occurring only when there is a conjunction of geologic events none of which might be capable of producing a global mass extinction by itself.},

The K/T boundary sequence on Seymour Island consists of a nearly continuous sequence of siliciclastic sediments deposited in a mid-shelf environment. The faunal changes across the boundary occur through a 30-m interval with no single extinction horizon, in contrast to other well-studied K/T boundary sections. The "expanded" nature of the Seymour Island section makes placement of the K/T boundary difficult because boundary indicators such as planktic foraminifera, ammonites, and dinocysts disappear at different levels within the section.},
